of laconice. No book would give you more ideas in fewer
words. Nowhere could you gain so much knowledge, and
lose so little time. The reader of „Tacitum who will study him
with pen in hand,· to mark, or refer to the most striking pas·
sages, will soon find himself master of a text book in moral
and political science, we might say a text book in human
nature, singularly concise and sententious, and what is not
always true even of concise and sententious writers, as singularly
wise and profound. In such a book, many of the speeches would
find a place entire3 for many of them are little else than
a , series of condensed, well-timed, and most instructive
apothegms.*

But the scholar, who is on the lookout, will find lurking in
every section, and almost every sentence, some important truth
in morals, in politice, in the individua] or social nature of man.
Neither the editor nor the teacher can be expected to develope
these sentiments, nor even, in many instances, to point them
out. That labor must be performed by the scholar3 and his
will be the reward.

No hasty perusal, no single reading of Tacitus, will give a
just conception of the surpassing richness of his works. They
must be studied profoundly to be duly appreciated. They are
a mine of wisdom, of vast extent and unknown depth, whose
treasures lie chiefly beneath the surface, imbedded in the solid
rock which must be entered with mining implements, explored
with strong lights, and its wealth brought up by severe toil
and sweat.
