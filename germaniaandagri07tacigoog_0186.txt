greater part of the MSS. and the later German editions. Auctionem
tributorum refers to the increased tribulae exacted by Vesp. cf.

Namque-coyebantur. The best version we can give of this ob·
scure passage is as follows: For they were compelled in mockery to
eit by the closed yranaries and to buy corn ncedlessly (beyond what
was necessary, cf. note on ultro, G. 28, when they had enough of

⁶ their own) and to cell it at a fixed price (prescribed by the pur·

chasers). Ιι has been made a question, whether the granaries of the
Britom, or those of the Romans are here meant. Ded„ Dr. and R.
advocate the former opinion3 walch, Wr„ Or., and Rit. the latter
According ιο the former view, the Britons were often obliged to
buy corn of the Romans, because they were forbidden to use their
own, ιο supply themselves and their families3 according to the lat·
ter, because they were required (as explained below) ιο carry their
contributions ιο a quarter so distant from their own granaries‚ that
they were fain ιο buy the corn rather aiz some nearer warehouse of
the Romans. The celliny at a fized price is equally intelligible on
either supposition. Or. following the best MSS. reads ludere pretio,
which Rit. has amended into colludere pretio. Ultro may well

contributions to such distant and inconvenient points, was to com-

to avoid compliance. The render of Cic. will remember in illustra-
tion of this whole passage, the various arte ’ω which Verres is said
ιο have had recourse ιο enrich himself, at the expense of the people
of his province (Cic. in Ver. 3, 72, and 82), such as refusing ιο accept
the contributione they brought, obliging them ιο buy of him at his
own price, requiring them ιο carry supplies ιο points most distant
and difficult of access, ut vecturae difficultate ad quam vellent aeeti-
mationem pervenirent·
