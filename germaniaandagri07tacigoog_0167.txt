Diliqenti ac moderato. Garqful and prudent, ct our authors
character of the same commander‚ His. 2, 25: cunctator natm-q etc-

Approbam't-fecit, ut ei probarentur. Dr. It is a constructio
praegnans. He obtained the first rudiments of a military education
under Paullinus, and he gained his approbation.

Rectus-aestimaret. Haciny been chocem as onewhom Ιισ would
mimate (i. e. test his merit) by tentinq toyetker, i. e. by making him
nis companion and aid. Young men of rank and promise were
thus associated with Roman commanders. Cf. Suet.. Caes. 2. T„ as
usual, avoids the technical way of expreoeing the relation. Ad
verbum, contubernium, cf. note, His. 1, 43. Others make aasz imaret
—diynum aestimaret, and contubernio abl. of price. cf. Ded.

Lieenter-seyniten sc. agens. Homer refers to voluptates, noym·-
ter to coenmeatua— Commeatusafiarlouth, absence from duty. —
Inscitiane, sc. tribunatus—&qnorum qf hie ‹fficial duty or inexpert-
ence in war. —Retulit Referre ad is used very much like the cor-
responding English, viz. to refer to an object, or devote to an end.
Sense: He did not take advantaqe of his official standinq and his
military inexpmieme, to qive up his time to ease and pleasurae. Wr.
takes retulit in the more ordinary sense of brought back, thus: A„
did not bring back (to Rome) the empty name of Tribune and no
military experience, there to give himself up to leisure and pleasure.
The former version accords better with the language of the whole
passage. Wr. questions the authority for such a use of rqferre. But
it may be found, e. g. Plin. Epist. 1, 22: nihil ad ostentationem,
omnia ad conscientiam rffcrt.

Noscere-aewoei, etc. T. is fond of such a series of inf. depending
on some one finite verb understood, and hence closely connected
with each other, cf. G. 30: praeponere, etc. note. Here supply from
retulit in the preceding number the idea: he made it his business
or aim to know, etc. The author’s fondness for antithesis is very ob-
servable in the several successive pairs here: noscero-nosci ,· discere-
sequi ,⁶ appetere-recusare ,· anxius-intentus.

In jactationem. Al. jactatione. In denoting the object or pur·
pose, Ζ. 314: he coveted no appointment sor the sake os display ,- lu
declined none thrmaqla sear.

Anxius and intentus qualify agere like adverbs cf. R. Exc. 23, l.
He conducted himself both with prudencc and with eneryy.

Exercitum—agitatior. So Cic. Som. Scip. 4: agitatus et exor-
itatus animus: and Hor. Epod. 9, 81: Syrtes Noto exercitatas.
