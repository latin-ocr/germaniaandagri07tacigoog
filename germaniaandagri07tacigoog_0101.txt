fresh confirmation from literature and science. Hence he speaks oi
the Germans as indiyenas, which he explains below by editum terra,
sprung from the earth, like the mutum et turpe pecus of Hor. Sat.
1, 3, 100. ef. Α. 11.

Mutare quaerebant. Quaerere with inf. is poet. constr„ found,
however, in later prose writers, and once in Cic. (de Fin. 313:
quaeris scire, enclosed in brackets in Tauchnitz’s edit-ion), to avoid
repetition os cupio. Cupio or volo mutare would be regular classic
prose.

Adversus. That the author here uses adversus in some unusual
and recondite sense, is intimated by the clause: ut sie dixerim. It
is understood by some, of a sea unsriendly to naviqation. But its
connexion ΒΥ que with immensus ultra, shows that it refers to posi-
tion, and means lyinq opposite, i. e., belonging, as it were, to another
hemisphere or world from ours; for so the Romans regarded the
N orthern Ocean and Britain itself, cf. A 12: ultra nostri orbis men·
suram ; Gr. 17 ε exterior oceanus. So Cic. (Som. Scip. 6.) says: Ι
Homines partim obliquos, partim aversos, partim etiam adversos,
stare vobis. This interpretation is confirmed by ab c·be nostra in
the antithesis. On the use of ut sic dixerim for ut sic dicam, which

. is peculiar to the silver age, see Z. 528.

Asia, sc. Minor. Africa, sc. the Roman Province of that name,
*comprising the territory of Carthage.—Peteret. The question im-
plies a negative answer, cf. Ζ. 530. The subj. implies a protasis
understood: if he could, or the like. Gr. 261, R. 4.

Sic. Praesens, ut de re vera. Giin. Nisi si is nearly equiva-
lent to nisi forte .· unless pei-chance ; unless if we may suppose the
case. Cf. Wr. note on Ann. 2, 63, and Hand’s TursellinuS, 3, 240.

Memoriae et annalium. Properly opposed to each other as tradi-
tion and written history, though we are ‘not to mser that written
books existed in Germany in the age of Tacitus.

Carminibus. Sonys, ballads (from cano). Songs and rude
poetry have been, in all savage countries, the memorials of publio
transactione, e. g. the runes of the Goths, the bards of the Britons
and celte, the scalde of scandinavia, ao.

Tuisconem. The god from whom Tuesday takes its name, as
Wednesday from woden, Thursday from Thor‚ &e., cf. Sharon ’Pur-
ner's His. of Ang. Sax. app. to book 2. chap. 3. Some find in tho
name of this god the root of the words Teutonic‚ Dutch (Germ.
Deutsche or Teutschex dxc. Al. Tuistonem, Tristonem, dte. More likely
