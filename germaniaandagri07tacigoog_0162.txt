cruel tyrant. Opus fuit stands instead of opus fuisset. Cf. His. 1,
16: diynus eram; 3, 22: ratio suit; and Ζ. 518, 519. The con-
cise mode of using the future participles narraturo and incursatum-5
(in place of the verb in the proper mood and with the proper con·
junctions, if, when, since) belongs to the silver age, and is foreign to
the language of Cicero. Such is the interpretation, which after a
thorough reinvestigation, I am now inclined to apply to this much
disputed passage. It is that of Ritter. It will be ‘seen that the text
also differs slightly from that of the first edition (in-cursaturus in·

the events here referred to took place (cf. 45: longae absentiae).

Hence the propriety of his saying leqimua rather than vidimus or ⁴

Paetus Thrasea. cf. Ann. 16, 21: Trucidatis tot insignibus
viris, ad postremum Nero virtutem ipsam exscindere concupivit, in-

Herennio Senecioni. Cf. Plin. (Epist. ’1, 19), where Senecio is
said to have written the life of Helvidius at the request of Fannia„
wife of Helvidius, who was also banished, as accessory to the crime,
but who bore into exile the very books which had been the cause
of her exile. For the dat. cf. note, G. 3: Ulisi.
