Tacitus was educated for the bar, and continued to plead
causes, occasionally at least, and with not a little success,
even after he had entered upon the great business of his life,
as a writer of history. We find references to his first, and
perhaps his last appearance, as an advocate, in the Lenem of
. Pliny, which are highly complimentary. The first was, when
Pliny was nineteen, and Tacitus a little older (how much we
are not informed), when Tacitus distinguished himself, so as
to awa-ken the emulation and the envy, though not in a bad
sense, of Pliny. The last was some twenty years later, when
Tacitus and Pliny, the tried friends of a whole life, the brightest
ornaments of literature and of the forum, were associated by
the choice of the Senate, and pleaded together at the bar of
the Senate, and in the presence of the Emperor Trajan, for
the execution of justice upon Marius Priscus, who was
accused of mal-administration in the proconsulship of Africa.
Pliny says, that Tacitus spoke with singular gravity and
eloquence, and the Senate passed a unanimous vote of appro-
bation and thanks to both the orators, for the ability and suc-
cess with which they had managed the prosecution (Plin.
Epis. ii. 11).

We have also the comments of Pliny on a panegyrical
oration, which Tacitus pronounced, when consul, upon his
predecessor in the consular office, Verginius Rufus, perhaps
the most remarkable man of his age, distinguished alike as
a hero, a statesman, and a scholar, and yet so modest or so
wine that he repeatedly refused the offer of the· imperial purple.
‘⁸ Fortune,'' says Pliny, “ always faithful to Verginius, reserved
for her last favor, such an orator to pronounce a eulogium on
such virtues. It was enough to crown the glory of a well
spent life” (Plin. Epis. ii. 1).
