111 my opinion, Harkuess’ Second Latin Book is an excellent manual. 'I'ho
epitomes of Roman and Grecian history which constitute the Reader are decidedly
superior in Latinity to those which have hitherto been in use. While the style is
very concise, lt is also clear, and the narrative sufficiently connectedto be interesting.
The notes are especially worthy of commendation, since they not only furnish trans-
lation of difficult words and passages, but also by the frequent references to grammar,
direct the attention of the learner to the distinction of the moods and the structure

and idioms of the language.

From J. F. Cam, Principal osthe Hiah School, Warren, R. I.

As no Latin book has yet appeared so suitable for beginners as your Fir-st Book,
so there is nothing so suitable for a sequol to it as your Second Book. 1 regard the
presentation of the parallel Latin and English idioma iu both books as an invaluable
feature, conducive alike to a clear and satisfactory understauding of the Latin, and to
precision and elegance in translating into English. The First and Second Latin
Books are altogether unrivalled3 they will-bear all reasonable tests, and will be more
fully appreciated the more fully they are understood.

From R. S. Howam), Principal ofthe Girle' Hiah school, Banaor.
1 have examined the work as far as 1 have been able, aud am much pleased with
it. 1 think it admirably adapted to accomplish the purpose for which it is designed.
It will, 1 have no doubt, have a wide circulatIon.

From G. Carrion, Prius-{pal of the Worceeter ΗίσῙι school.

The exercises which are to be studied in connection with the reading lessons
render the Second Latin Book invaluable for the young scholar. The pupil who goe!
through these exercises, in accordance with the design of the author, must, of neces-
city, caremlly study the text, and, by a constant repetition of the words and sentences,
become familiar with the vocabulary‚ and fix in the mind the construction and
idioms of the language. The book seems to me admirably adapted to introduco the
scholar to the study of the classic authors.

From R. S. «lausa, Principal os the Hiqh Βεὴοοῑ, Nor-walle, Gonu.

In substituting the concise histories of tho Roman Empire and of Greece for the
ridiculous mythology and trifling anecdotes of former Readers, you have rendered an
incalculable service to the minds of the young. But the chief excellence of the work
consiste in the superior manner in which the principles of the grammar are devel-
oped and illustrated. Your series is used in this institution, and we find 1t a
pleasure to teach with such booka

strom V. G. Wama, Primipaz ofthe Euat Corinth Δοαᾶσπιῃ, Maia e.
Harkness' Second Latin Book is Just what is needed in our schools. 1 think it the
most thorough and complete work on the construction of Latin sentences 1 have
ever seen. 1 believe it well calculated to interest the scholar iu those parts com-
monly dry and difficult, and by a series of progressive exercises to give a great
amount of knowledge with less than tho ordinary amount of study.

From S. Η. Tanos, Principal ofPlzillip'a Academy, Δηάουον, Mass.

The author, who is a very successful teacher, has just views of the manner in which
the Latin should be studied‚ and has clearly and happily embodied these 111 1118 book,
which in all Its parts is well executed, and 1 regard it as very bappily adapted to give ἱ
the pupil who will faithfully study it critical aud comprehensive views of the Latir
