which itis hoped may serve to exhibit the author in his relation
to the history, and especially to the literature, of his age.

4. The department in which less remained to be done than
any other, for the elucidation of Tacitae, was that of Geography.
History, and Archaeology. The copioue notes of Gordon and
Murphy lest little to be desired in this line3 and these notes are
not only accessible to American scholare in their original forms,
· but have been incorporateds more or less, into all 'the college
editione. If any peculiar merit attaches to thie edition, in this
department, it will be found in the frequent references to such
classic authors as furnish collateral information, and in the
illustration of the private life of the Romane, by the help of such
recent works as Becker's Gallae. The editor has also been

· able to avail himself of Sharon Turner’s History of the Anglo

Gruber, Kiessling, Dronke, Roth, Ruperti, and Walther.

The text is, in the main, that of Walther, though the other
editors just named have been consulted ς and in such minor
differences ae exist between them, I have not hesitated to adopt
the reading which seemed best to accord with the usage and
genius of Tacitus, especially when sanctioned by a deoided pre·
ponderance of critical suffr-age. Other readings have been
referred to in the Notes, so far as they are of any considerable
importance, or supported by respectable authority. Partly for
convenience, but chiefly ae a matter of taste, Ι have ventured
to follow the German editions in dispensing entirely with diacri
tical marks, and in some peculiarities of less importance, which

if not viewed with favor, it is hoped, will not be judged with
