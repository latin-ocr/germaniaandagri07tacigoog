asserting that Ulysses built the city of myssinga, and Circe iounded
that of Circzea or Ziriezeei” Murphy.

Fabula-so errore. Storied celebrated in sony, cf. fabulosus Hy·
daspes. Hor. Od. 1, 227. Ulysses having wandered westward gave
plausibility to alleged traces of him in Gaul, Spain and Germany
—Asciburqium Now Asburg. ⁴*

Quin etiam, cf. notes, 13: quin etiam, and 14: quin imma— Uliaei.
i. e. ab Ulixe, cf. Ann. 15, 41: Aedes statoris Jovis Romulo vota, i. e.
by Romulus. This usage is especially frequent in the poets and the
later prose writerS, cf. Gr. 225, 11; Ζ. 419; and in T. above all
others, cf. Bet. Lex. Tac. sub Dativus. Wr. and Rit. understand
however an altar (or monument) consecrated to Ulysses, i. e. erecte-d
in honor of him by the citizens.

Adjecto. Inscribed with the name of his fat-her, as well as his
own, i. e. Λαερτιάδῃ.

Graecis litteris. Grecian characters, cf. Caes. B. G. 1, 29: In
castris Helvetiorum, tabulae repertae sunt litteris Graecis confectae3
and (6, 14): Galli in publicis privatisque rationibus Graecis utun-⁴
tur litteris. T. speaks (Anu. 11, 14) of alphabetic characters, as
passing from Phenicia into Greece, and Strabo (4, 1) traces them
from the Grecian colony at Marseilles‚ into Gaul, whence they
doubtless passed into Germany‚ and even into Britain.

IV. Aliis aliarum. The Greek and Latin are both fond of a
repetition of different cases of the same word, even where one of
them is redundant, e. g. οἰόθεν οἶος (Hom. 11. ¹7, 39), and particu
larly in the words ἄλλος and alius. Aliis is not however wholly
redundant; but brings out more fully the idea : no intermarriayes,
one with one nation, and another with another. Walch and Ritter
omit aliis, though it is found in all the MSS.

Infectoa Things are said infici and imbui, which are so pene·
trated and permeated by something else, that that something be-
comes a part of its nature or substance, as inficere colore, sanguine,
veneno, animum virtutibus. It does not necessarily imply corrup·
tion or degeneracy.

Propriam-similem. Three epithets not essentially dmerent,
used for the sake of emphasis=peculiar, pure, and wi-qeneris.
Similis takes the gen„ when it expresses, as here, an internal re·
semblance in chat-actem otherwise the dat„ cf. Ζ. 411.

Habitus. Form and features, external appearance. The physi-
cal features of the Germane as described· by Tacitus, though still
sufficient to distinguish them from the more southern European
