severity. The punctuation is the result of a diligent comparison
of the best editions,'together with a careful study of the con·
nexion of language and of thought.

The German editions above mentioned, together with severa.
French, English, and American works, have not only been con-
stantly before me, but have been used with great freedom, and
credit awarded to them accordingly. Some may think their
names should have appeared less frequently3 others that they
should have received credit to a still greater extent. Suffice it
to say, I have never intended to quote the language, or borrow
the thoughts of an author, without giving his name; and in mat·
ters of fact or opinion, I have cited authorities not only whenl
have been indebted to them for the suggestion, but whenever, in
a case of coincidence of views, I thought the authorities would
be of any interest to the student. .

Ι have not considered it needful, with German scrupulosity, to
distinguish between my own references and those of othei-S. It
may safely be taken for granted, that the major, perhaps the bet-
ter, part of them have been derived from foreign sources. But
no references have been admitted on trust. They have been care· ,
fully verified, and it is hoped that numerous as they are, they
will be found pertinent and useful, whether illustrative of things,
or of mere verbal usage. Some, who use thu oook, mu doubtless
find occasionto follow them out eitherv in whole or in part3 anu
those who do not, will gain a general impression as to the sources
from which collateral information may be obtained, that will bs
of no small value.

The frequent references to the Notes of Professor Kingsley¹
will show the estimation in which I hold them. Perhaps I have
used them too freely. My only apology ia, that so far as they
go, they are just what is wanted3 and if I had avoided using
them to a considerable extent, I must have substituted something
less perfect of my own. Had they been more copious, and
extended more to verba] and grammatica] illustrationS, these
Notes never would have appeared.

The editor is convinced, from his experience as a teacher,
that the student of Tacitus will not master the difficulties, or
appreciata the merita, of so peculiar an author, unless his
