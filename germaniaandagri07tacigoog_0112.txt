odiu), was a prominent object of worship among all the nations ol
Northern Europe. Mars is perhaps the German god of war (Tiw, Tiu,
Tuisco) whence Tuesday, French Mardi, cf. Tur. His. Ang. Sax. App.
to B. 2. chap. 3. Herculem is omitted by Ritter on evidence (partly
external and partly internal) which is entitled to not a little con·
sideration. Hercules is the god of strength, perhaps Thor.

Certis diebus. Statis diebus. Giin.

Humanis-hostiis. Even facere in the sense of sacrific-ests con-
strued with abl. Virg. Ec. 3, 7⁷. Quoque-even. For its position
in the sentence, cf. note, 3.

Camenis animalibus. Such as the Romans and other civilized
nations offer, in contradistinction to human sacrifices, which the
author regards as ‹Cn-concessa. The attempt has been made to re-
move from the Germans the stain of human sacrifices. But it rests
on incontrovertible evidence (cf. Tur. His. Ang. Sam, App. to B. 2.
cap. 3), and indeed attaches to them only in common with nearly
all uncivilized nations. The Gauls and Britons, and the Celtic
nations generally, carried the practice to great lengths, cf. Caes. B.
G. 6, 15. The neighbors of the Hebrews offered human victims in
great numbers to their gods, as we learn from the Scriptures. N ay,
the reproach rests also upon the Greeks and Romans in their early
history. Pliny informs us, that men were sacrificed as late as the
year of Rome 657.

[eidi. The Egyptian Isis in Germanyl This shows, how far
the Romans went in comparing the gods of different nations. Gr.
Ritter identifies this goddess with the Nertha of chap. 40, the

Egyptian Isis and Nertha being both equivalent to Mother Earth,
the Terra or Tellus of the Romans.

Liburnae. A light galley, so called from the Liburniam, a peo-
ple of Illyricum, who built and navigated them. The siqnum, here
likened to a galle y, was more probably a rude crescent, connected
with the worship of the moon, cf. Caes. Β. G. 6, 21: Germani
deorum numero ducunt Solem et Lunam.

Cohibere parietibucuaedificiis includere, K. T. elsewhere speaks
of temples of German divinities (e. g. 40: templum Nerthi; Anu.
1, 51: templum Tanfanae); but a consecrated grove or any other
sacred place was called templum by the Romans (templum from
τέμνω, cut off, set apart).
