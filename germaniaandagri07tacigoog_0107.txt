90 noras,

Suu-s honor. Their proper, i. e. usual size and beauty.

Gloria frontis. Poetice for cornua. Their horns were small.

Numero. Emphatic: number, rather than quality. Or, with
Ritter, ⁸‹Jaudeut may be taken in the sense of enjoy, possess: they Ιιαυα

Perinde. Not so much as miykt be expected, or as the Romans,
end other civilized nations. So Gronovius, Ded. and most com·
mentators. See Rup. in loc. “ othere, as Or. and Rit. allow no
ellipsis, and render: not much. See Hand's Tursellinus vol. IV. p.
454. We sometimes use not so much, not so very, not so bad, dte„
for not very, not much, and not bad. Still the form of expression
strictly implies a'comparison. And the same is true of haud perinde,
cf. Bet. Lex. Tac.

purer silver than those of tho Emperors.” Ky. Cf. Pliny, Η. Ν.
