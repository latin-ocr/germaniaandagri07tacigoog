why does not appear.

Superfuere. Cf. superest, G. 6, note.

XLVI. Sapientibus. Cf. sapientiae professoribus, 2, note—213
immortalibus laudibus. I feel constrained to recur to the reading
of Lipsius and Ritter, it is so much more spirited than quam tem·
poralibus. Potius manifestly should refer back to luyeri and
planqi. The comparison contained in the more common reading is
uncalled for in the connection, and of little significance in itselfi
The Mffl. read temporalibus laudibus without quam and this may
be more easily resolved into te immortalibus, than quam can be
supplied. — Similitudine. Al. aemulatione. For such a use cf
similitude, cf. Cic. Tusc- Quaest. 1, 46, 110: quorum (sc. curii,
Fabricii, Scipionum, etc), similitudinem aliquam qui arripuerit, etc.

Decoremus. Ennius (cited by Cic. Tusc- Q„ 1, 49, 117, and de
Seneet. 20, 73), uses the same word in expressing the same senti-
ment: nemo me lacrumis decoret nec funera fletu faxit. Of. also
G. 26.

Formam. This makes the sense so much better (than famam),
that E. Dr. Wr. R. and most others have adopted it against the
authority of the MSS. cf. forma mentis, below, and Cic-passim.

lutea-cedendum. To be prohibited. Properly said of a veto inter-
posed by the Tribunes; then of any prohibition.—Non quia—not
that, is characteristic of late writers. It is followed by the subj.
Z. 537, and note H. 1, 15.

Manet, mansurumque est. Cf. Vell. Patere. 2, 66, 5: vivit,
vivetque per omnem saeculorum memoriam. The periphrastic form
(mansurum est) differs however from the future (manebit), as our
is to remain from will remain. See Z. 498.

Oblivio obruet, sc. for want of a historian, carent quia vato
sacro, cf. Hor. Od. 4, 9, 26, seq. By multos veterum, T. means many
ancients of real worth. So velut implies. A. is to be immortalized
through his biographer. This is implied in narratus et traditus. ⁷
Ancient authors thought it not improperto express a calm conscious-
ness of merit and a proud confidence of immortality. T. is very
modest and delicate in the manner of intimating his expectatione.
But the sentiment of these last words is substantially the same
with the line of Horace: Exegi monumentum aere perennius. The
whole peroration of this Biography is one of singular beauty and
moral elevation. Pathetic, yet calm, rich in noble sentimenta and
animaoed by the purest and lostiest spirit, it is a fit topstone to
