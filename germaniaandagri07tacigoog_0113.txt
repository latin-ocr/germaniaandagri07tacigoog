96 NOTES.

Humani-speciem. Images of the gods existed at a later day
in Germany (S. Tur. His. of Ang. Sax„ App. to B. 2. cap. 3). But
this does not prove their existence in the days of T. Even aa
late as A. 1). 240 Gregory Thaumaturgus expressly declares, there
were no images among the Goths. N 0 traces of temple-walls or
images have been discovered in connection with the numerous sites
of ancient altars or places of offering ‘which have been exhumed in
Germagzy, though both these are found on the horden, both south

and west, ef. Ukert, p. 236.

Christiansty, the Germans were disinclined to the image-worship of
the Papists.

lots: but both often used in the general sense of omens, eracles.

Ut qui maxime, sc. observant. Ellipsis supplied by repeating
observant=to the greatest extent, none more.

Simpleae. Sine Romana arte, cf. Cic. de Div. 2‘, 41, K. The
Scythians hadasimilar method of divining, Herod. 4, 67. Indeed, the
practice of divininy by rods has hardly ceased to this day, among

Si publice consuletur. If the question to be decided is of a
public nature. (loriculam, fut„ because at the time of drawing
