AGRIGOLA.

 

Tm Biography of Agricola was written early in the reign of Trajan
(which commenced A. U. C. 851. A. D. 98), consequently about the
same time with the Germania, though perhaps somewhat later (οἱ
notes on Germania). This date is established by inference from the
author‘s own language in the 3d and the 44th sections (see notes).
In the former, he speaks of the dawn of a better day, which opened
indeed with the reign of Nerva, but which is now brightening con-
stantly under the auspices of Trajan. The use of the past tense
(miscuerit) here in respect to Nerva, and of the present (augeat) in
respect to Trajan, is quite conclusive evidence, that at the time of
writing, the reign of Nerva was past, and that of Trajan had
already begun.

The other passage is, if possible, still more clearly demonstrative
of the same date. Here in drawing the same contra-st between past
tyranny and present freedom, the author, without mentioning Nerva
records the desire and hope, which his father-in-law expressed in his
hearing, that he might live to see Trajan elevated to the imperial
throne—language very proper and courtly‚ if Trajan were already
Emperor, but a very awkward 'compliment to Nerva, if, as many
critics suppose, he were still the reigning prince.

It is objected to this date, that if Nerva were not still living, Taci-
tus could not have failed to attach to his name (in § 3.) the epithet
Divus, with which deceased Emperors were usually honored. And
from the omission of this epithet in connection with the name of
Nerva, together with the terms of honor in which Trajan is men-
tioned, it is inferred that the piece was written in that brief period
of three months, which intervened between the adoption of Trajan
by Nerva, and Nerva’s death (see Brotier and many others). But
