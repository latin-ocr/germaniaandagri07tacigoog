of eos, for if the Germane were the subject of memorant, ce must
have been used. On the use of et hei-,e cf. note 11.

Primum—ut principem, fol tissimum. Giin.

Haec quoque. Haec is rendered such by Ritter. But it seems
rather, as Or. and Ded. explain it, to imply nearness and familiarity
to the mind of the author and his readers: these well known songs.
So 20: in haec corpora, quae miramur. Quoque, like quidem, fol·
lows the emphatic word in a clause, Gr. 17 9, 33 Ζ. 355.

Relatu, called cantus trux, H. 2, 22. A Tacitean word. Freund.
Cf. Η. 1, 30.

Baritum. Al. harditum and barritum. But the latter has no

ms. authority, and the former seems to have been suggested by the
bards of the Gauls, of whose existence among the Germane however
there is no evidence. Ded. says the root of the word is common to
the Greek, Latin, and German languages viz. baren, i. e. fremere, a
verb still used by the Batavians, and the noun bar, i. e. carmen.
of frequent occurrence in Saxon poetry to this day.
ρ Terrent trepidantve. They inspiro terror or tremblc with sear,
accordinq as the line (the troops drawn up in battle array) han
mnded, sc. the baritus or battle cry. Thus the Batavians per-
ceived, that the conitus aciei on the part of the Romans was more
feeble than their own, and pressed on, as to certain triumph. H. 4,
18. So the Highlanders augured victory, if their shouts were
louder than those of the enemy. See Murphy in loco.

Repemcssu. A post-Augustan word. The earlier Latin authors
would have said repercussa, or repercutiendo. The later Latin, like
the English, uses more abstract terme—Nec tam-videntur. Nor do
those carmina· seem to be so much voices (well modulated and har·
monized)‚ as acclamations (unanimous, but inarticulate and indis-

tinet) of com-aye. So Pliny uses concentus of the acclamations of .

the' people. Panegyr. 2. It is often applied by the poets to the
concerts of birds, as in Virg. Geor. 1, 422. It is herc plural, cf.
Or. in loc. The reading vocis is without MS. authority.

Ulixem. “The love of fabulous history, which was the passion
of ancient times, produced a new Hercules in every country, and
made Ulysses wander on every shore. Tacitus mentions it as a
romantic tale; but Strabo seems willing to countenance the fiction,
and gravely tells us that Ulysses founded a city, called Odyssey, in
Spain. Lipsius observes, that Lisbon, in the name of Strabo, had
the appellation of Ulysippo, or Olisipo. At this rate, he pleasantly
adds, what should hinder us inhabitants of the Low Countries from
