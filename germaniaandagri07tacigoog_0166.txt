AGmcoLA. 149

the high culture and refinement of Massilia (Cic. pro Flacco, 26).-
Provinciali parsimonia. Parsimonia in a good sense; economy,
as opposed to the luxury and extravagance of Italy end the Gity.

Locum-mixtum Enallagc' for locus, in quo mixta erant, etc.
Gr. 323, 3, cf. 25: mixti copiis et laetitia.'—Bene·compositum denotes
a happy combination of the elements of which mixtum expresses
only the ‹to-eoeistence.

Acrius, sc. aequo—too eagerly. Gr. 256. R. 9.

Concessum-senatori. Military ·and civil studies were ‹leemed
more appropriate to noble Roman youth, than literature and philo·
sophy. Senatori must of course refer, no· to the office of A„ but to
his rank by birth, cf. senatorii ordinis above.

Hausisse, ni-coercuisset. An analysis of this sentence shows,
that there is an ellipsis of hausurum fuisse: he imbibat, and would
have continued to imbibe, had not, dic. In such sentences, which
abouud in T. but are rarely found in Cic„ ni is more readily trans·
lated by but. ' Cf. Z. 519. b ; and note, His. 3, 28. For the applica-
tion of haurire to the eager study of philosophy, cf. Hor. sat. 2, 4,
95: haurire vitae praecepta beatae, and note, His. 1, 51‘: hauserunt
ammo.

is the regular Latin construction. Τ. uses both. Cf. Z. 690, and
note, His. 1, 83.

Mox. In Τ. subsequently, not presently. R.

Retinuitque—modum. And, what is most diffie-ult, he retained
from philosoph-y moderatiore-moderation in all things, but especially
in devotion to philosophy itself, where moderatiori is difficult in
proportion to the excellence of the pursuit, as was shown by the
extravagance of the Stoics and some other Grecian sects. As to the
sense of modum, cf. Hor. Sat. 1, 1, 106: est modus in rebus ,·' and for the
sentiment, Hor. Ep. 1, 6, 15: Insani sapiens nomen' serat, aequus
iniqui, ultra quam satis est virtutem si petat ipsam.

V. Castrorum. 'This word is used to express whatever per-
tains to military life, education, dvc„ as the context may require.
Evcry Roman youth who aspired to civil office, must have a mili·
tsry education.
