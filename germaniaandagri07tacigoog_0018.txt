-LIFE OF TACITUS.

 

11· is the office of genius and learning, as of light, to illustrate
other thingS, and not itself. The writers, wh0, of all others
perhaps, have told us most of the world, just as it has been
and is, have told us least of themselves. Their character we
may infer, with more or less exactneSS, from their works, but
their history is unwritten and must for ever remain sc. Homer,
though, perhaps, the only one who has been argued out of
existence, is by no means the only one whose age and birth-
place have been disputed. The native place of Tacitus is
mere matter of conjecture. His parentage is not certainly
known. The time of his birth and the year of his death are
ascertained only by approximation, and very few incidente are
recorded in the history of his life3 still we know the period in
which he lived, the influences under which his character was
developed and matured, and the circumstances under which he
wrote his immortal works. In short, we know his times,
though we can scarcely gather up enough to denominate his
ltfe ,- and the times in which an author lived, are often an
important, not to say, essential means of elucidating his “
writings. ⁴
