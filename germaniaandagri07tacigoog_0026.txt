of the schools had infected all the departments of literature.
Simple narrative no *longer suited the pampered taste of the
readers or the writers of history. It must be highly seasoned
with sentimentalism and moralizing, with romance and poetry.
Tacitus, certainly, did not escape the infection. In the lan·
guage of Macaulay, “ He carries his love of effect far beyond
the limits of moderatiori. He tells a fine story finely, but he
cannot tell a plain story plainly. He stimulates, till stimulante
lose their power.’'* We have taken occasion in the notes to
point out not a few examples of rhetorical pomp, and poetical
coloring, and even needless multiplicatiori of words, where
plainness and precision would have been much better, and
which may well surprise us in a writer of 30 much conciseness.
Lord Mouboddo, in a very· able, though somewhat extravagant
critique on Tacitus, has selected numerous 11131011003 of what
he calls the ornamented dry style, many of which are 30 00110130,
30 rough‚ and 30 broken, that he says, they do not deservo the
name of composition, but seem rather like the raw materiale of
history, than like history itself (Orig. 01111 Prog. of Lang., vol
111. chap. 12).

still, few readers can fail to pronounce Tacitus, as Macaulay
affirms, and even Lord Mouboddo admits him to be, the greatest
of Latin historians, superior to Thucydides himself in the
moral painting of his best narrative 3001103, 01111 111 1110 110111100-

a superior among dramatists and novelists. The common style
of his narrative is, indeed, wanting in simplicity, and some-
times in perspicuity. He does not deal enough in the specific ·
and the picturesque, the where, the when and the how. But
