Gnnmu. 97

Ter sinyulos tollit. A three-sold drawing for the sake of eer-
tainty. Thus Ariovistus drew lots three times touching the death
of Valerius (Caes. B. Gr. 1, 53). So also the Romans drew lots three
times, Tibul. 1, 3, 10: sortes ter sustulit. Such is the interpreta-
tion of these disputed words by Griiber, Ritter and many others,
and such is certainly their natural and obvious meaning: ke takes
up three times one after another all the slips he has mattea-ed (spar-
9m is hardly applicable to three only): if the signs are twice or
thrice favorable, the thing is permitted; if twice or thriee unfavor- -
able it is prohibited. The language of Caesar (in loc. eit.) is still
more explicit: ter sortibus con-mltum. But Or., Wr. and Ded.
understand simply the taking up of three lots one each time.

Si prohibuerunt sc. sortes===dii. The reading prohibuerunt (al.
prohibuerint) is favored by the analogy of ci displicuit, 11, and
other passages. Sin (επεὶ-πε) is particularly frequent in antithesis
with εἰ, and takes the same construction after it.

Auspiciorum-exiqimr.· Auspiciorum, here some other omens,
than lots; such as the author proceeds to specify. Adhuc—ad hoe,
praeterea, i. e. in addition to the lots. The sense is: besides draw-
inq lota, the persua-sion produced by auspices is required.

Etiam hic. In Grex-many also (as well as at Rome and other
well known countries). Hic is referred to Rome by some. But
it was hardly needful for T. to inform the Romans of that custom
at Rome.

Proprium yemis. Ic is a peculiarity of the German race. It
is not, however, exclusively German. Something similar pre·
vailed among the Persians‚ Herod. 1, 189. ’7, 55. Darius Hystaspes
was indebted to the neighing of his horse for his elevation to the
throne.

Rsckm memor-ibus, ὗ 9.-Μονιαῑί opere-hominum opere.—

Gon-scios, sc. deorum. ῚῚιε priests consider themselves the ser-
vants of the qod-3, the hor-ses the confidant-3 of the same. So Tibullus
speaks of the conscia fibra deorum. Tibul. 1, 8, 3.

Committunt. Gon and mitto, send together—enyaye in fiyht.
A technieal expression used of gladiatore and champions.

Praejudicio. Suro proquo-atio. ⁶ Montesquieu finds in this eus-
tom the origin of the duel and of knight-errantry.

XI. Apud-pmractentur. Are handled, i. e. diseussed, among,
i. e. by the chiese, sc. before being referred to the people.
