that monument, in respect to which Τ. felt so well founded an
assurance, which still manet mansurumque est in animis hominum,
in aeternitate temporum, fama rerum. Tbere is scarcely an edu-
cated youth in Christendom who is not as familiar with the name
of Agricola, as with that of AEneas and Ulysses. And the only
reason why we know anything of these heroes, is the genius of their
respective biographers. There had been other Agricolas before
the age of Trajan, as there had been other heroes like AEneas, and
other wandering sages like Ulysses‚ before the war of Troy. But
they found no Tacitus,‘ virgil, and Homer to record their adventur-
ous and virtuous deeds. Itis the prerogative of eminent writers
to confer immortality; and though Alexander would prefer to be
Achilles rather than Homer, we should have known little of hia
achievements, had he not encouraged scholars as well as warrior&
and rewarded genius no less than valor.
