Tacitus is decidedly superior to Livy. The characters of Livy
are distinguishable only as classes—the good all very good.
the bad very bad, the indifferent very indifferent. You dis·
cover no important difference between a Fabius and a Marcellae,
further than it lies on the face of their actions. In Tacitus,
the characters are all individuaIS. Each stands out *distinctly
from the surrounding multitude, and not only performs his
own proper actions, bu‘t is governed by his own peculiar
motives. Livy places before us the statues of heroes and
gods3 Tacitus conducts us through the crowd of living men.
In an attempt to sketch the most striking features of Tacitus,
as a writer, no critic can omit to mention his sage and pithy
maxims. Apothegms abound on every page—sagacious, truth-
ful, and profound in sentiment, in style concise, antithetic and
sententious Doubtless he is excessively fond of pointed
antithesis. Perhaps he is too much given to. moralizing and
reflection. It waS, as we have said,the fault of his age. But
no one, who is familiar with Seneca, will severely censure
Tacitus. He will only wonder that he should have risen so
far above the faults of his contemporaries. Indeed, Tacitus
interweaves his reflections with so much propriety, and clothes
his apothegms with so much dignity—he is so manifestly com-
petent to instruct the world by maximS, whether in civil, social,
or indi·⁷idual life, that we are far from wishing he had indulged
in it less. His reflections do not interrupt the thread of his
narrative. They grow naturally out of his incidente. They
break forth spontaneously from the lips of his men. His
history is indeed philosophy teaching by examples3 and his
pithy saylngs are truly lessons of wisdom, embodied in the
form most likely to strike the attention, and impress the
memory. We should love to see a collection of apothegms
. from the pen of Tacitus. It would make an admirable book
