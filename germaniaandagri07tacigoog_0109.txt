Centeni. A hundred is a favorite number with the Germana

and their descendants. Witness the hundred payi of the Suevi
(Caes. Β. G. 4, 1), and of the Semnones (G. 39), the cantone of
Switzerland, and the hundreda of our Saxon ancestors in England.
'The centeni here are a military division. In like manner, Caesar
(B. G. 4, 1) speaks of a thousand men drafted annually from each
payns of the Suevi, for military service abroad.

quue ipsum. Predicate nominative after a verb of calling, Gr.
210, 3 (3); Z. 394. The division was called a hundred, and each
man in it a hundrcder; and such was the estimation in which this
service was held, that to be a hundreder, became an honorable
distinction, nomen et honora-honorificum nomen.

not without some rcgard to hereditary distinctions. They chose
(sumunt) their sovereign, but chose him from the royal family, or
at least one of noble extraction. They chose also their commander
—the king, if he was the braves‘t and ablest warrior; if not, they
were at liberty to choose some one else. And among the Germana,
as among their descendants the Franks, the authority of the com-
mander was quite distinct from, and sometimes (in war) paramount
to, that of the king. Here Montesquieu and others find the original
of the kings of the first race in the French monarchy, and the
mayors os the palace, who once had so much power in France. Cf.
Sp. ofLaw,s B. 31, chap. 4.
