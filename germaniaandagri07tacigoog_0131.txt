Ut colono. Like the tenant or farmer among the Romans; also
the vassal in the middle ages, and the serf in Modern Europe.

Hactenus. Thus far, and no farther, i. e. if he pays his rent or
tax, no more is required of him.

Cetera. The rest os the dutica (usually performed by a Roman
servant), viz. those of the house, tlte msc and children (sc. of the
master) perform. Gr. strangely refers uxor et liberi to the wife and
children of the servant. Passow also refers domus to the house ο]
the servant, thus making it identical with the penates above, with
which it seems rather to be contrasted. With the use of cetera here,
compare His. 4, 56: ceterum vulqus—the rest, viz. the common
soldiers, and see the principle well illustrated in Doderlein's Essay,
His. p. 17.

Opere. Hard labor, which would serve as a punishment. The
Romans punished their indolent and refractory domestics, by send· *
ing them to labor in the country, as well as by heavy chains (vin-
culis) and cruel flagellations (verberare). They had also the power
of life and death (occidere). Beck. Gall. Exc. 2. Sc. 23 Smith’s Dic.
Ant. as above.

with this difference in the idea: libertus=the freedman of some
particular master, libertinus=one in the condition of a freedman
without reference to any master. At the time of the Decemvirate,
and for some time after, liberti=emancipated slaves, libertini==the
descendants of such, cf. Suet. Claud. 24.

Quae reynantur. Govcrncd by kinys. Ex poetarum more dio·
