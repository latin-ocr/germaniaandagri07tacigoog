Alius. Another than the Emperor.-—Oecuparet—pre·oceupy, st

Utcumque. Somehow, possibly, perhaps. Other thinys perhaps

Quodque-satiatus. And what was a proof of some eruel pur·
pose, wholly absorbed in his retirement (where he never plotted any
thing but mischiess and where in early life he is said to have
amused himself with killing flies, Suet. Dom. 3). Cf. Plin.
Panegyr. 48: nee unquam ex solitudine sua prodeuntem, nisi ut
solitudinem faceret. The whole passage in Pliny is a graphio pie-
ture of the same tyrant, the workings of whose heart are here so
laid bare by the pen of Pliny’s friend Tacitus. Secreto-satiatus
may also be translated: satisfied with. his own secret, i. e. keeping to
himself his eherished hatred and jealousy. —Lanytoeseeret. Subj.

fices and thanksgivings were offered in the name of the victorious
commender. Dr. ⁷

Addique. Al. additque. Addique is the reading of the MSS.
and old editions. And it suits better the genius of Dom.; he did
not express the opinionem himself, for it was not his real intention,
but he ordered some one to put it in circulation ss if from him,
that he might have the eredit of it and yet not ba bound by it.—
Destinari, sc. by Domitian.
