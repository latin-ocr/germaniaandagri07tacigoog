This work is designed as a sequel to the author’s “First Latin BookN It com·
prises a complete analytical syntax, exhibiting the 0880111101 structure of 1110 Latin
ianguage, from 118 simplest to its most expanded and elaborate form.

The arrangement of the Iessons is decidedly philosophical, gradually progressive,
81111111 811101 accordance with the law of development oi' the human mind. Eve'ry

‚new principle is stated in simple, clear, and accurate language, and illustrated by
examples carefully selected from the reading Iessons‚ which the student 18 required
10 translate, analyze‚ and reconstruct. He is also exercised in forming new Latin
sentences on given models. This, while it gives variety and interest to what would
otherwise 00 111 1110 highest degree monotenous, completely fixes in the mind the
subject of the Iesson, both by analysis and synthesis.

The careful study of this volume, on the plan recommended by the author, wil
greatly facultate <ue pupil’s progress in the higher departments of the lang-uago. Such
Ξ 8 the testimony of the numerous institutions in which Harkness's improved edition
of Arnold has been introduced.

sor Reading, the Notes and Rules for Translating, the Exercises in Translating into
