Aamcons. 161

also Freund sub v. The fact alleged in thi's sentence is as false
as the philosophy by which it is explained in the next, cf. G. 45:
in ortus, note.

Scilicet-cadit. This explanation proceeds on the assumption
that night is caused by the shadow of mountain& behind which the
sun sets; and since these do not exist in that level extremity
of the earth, the sun has nothing to set behind, and so there is
no night. The astronomy of T. is about of a piece with his natural
philosophy, οἱ 10. - Εέίνετηα-ιετναντιπι. cf. note, 6: inania
honoris.

Non erigunt, lit. do not elevate the darkness, i. e. do not cast
their shadow so high (infraque—cadit), as the sky and the starsg
hence they are bright (clara) through the nightll Pliny also
supposed the heavens (above the moon) to be of themselves per-
petually luminous, but darkened at night by the shadow of the
earth. N. H. 2, 7.

Praeter. Beyond. Hence either besides or except. Here the

Ang. come sorward.

Fert-aurum, etc. This is also affirmed by Sti abo 4, 5, 2, but

siderable quantities that gold and silver have ever been found in
Britain.

Margarita. The neuter form of this word is seldum used, never
by Cicero, See Freund sub v.

Rubro mari. The Red Sea of the Greeks and 'Romans em
braced both the Arabian and the Persian Gulfs; and it was in the
latter especially, that pearls were found, as they are to this day.
cf. Plin. N. H. 9, 54: praecipue laudantur (margaritae) in Persico
sinu maris rubri. For an explanation of the name (Red Sea), see
Anthon’s Classical Dictionary.

E'qmlsa sint. Cast out, i. e. askore, by the waves. Subj.
in a subordinate clause of the oratio obliqua. Gr. 266, 2 ; Ζ.
603.

Naturam—avaritiam. A very characteristic sentence, both for
ite antithesis and its satire.

XIII. Ipsi Britanni. Ipsi marks the transition from the
country to the people‚ cf. ipsos Germanos, G. 2.
obeunt properly applies onlyto munera, not to tributa and deleo-
