'l'he present work is what its title iudicatos, strictly an mondoum and 811118 u
spply the methods which have proved so successful in the acquIsItion of the moder·
huguages to the study of Ancient Greek, with such differences as the different genius
of the Greek, and the different purposes for whlch it is studied, suggest. It differs
stom the modern Ollendorffs 111 containIng exercises for recipi-ocal translation, in
oonflning them within a smaller compass, and in a more methodical exposition of the
principles of the language.

The leading object of the author was to furnish a book which should serve as 811
mroduction to the study of Greek, and precede the use of any grammar. It will
therefore be found, although not claiming to embrace all the principles of the Gram-
mar, yet complete in itselfss and will lead the pupil, by insensible gmdations, from th·
simpler constructions to those which are more complicated and difficult. The excep—
tions‚ and the moro idiomatic forms, it studiously avoids, aiming only to ethbit the
regular and ordinary usages of the language as the proper starting-point for the stu-
dent’s further rescarches.

In presenting these, the author has aimed to combine the strictest accuracy with
the utmost simplicity of statement. Hls work is therefore adapted to 8 younger clas·
ef pupils than have usually engaged in the study of Greek, and will, it is hoped‚ win
to the acquisition of that noble tongue many 111 our academies and primary school·
who have been repelled by the less slmple character of our ordinary text—books.

'I'hese Exercises consist of easy sentences, similar to those in the Anubim, in
hving the same words and constructione, and are designed by frequent repetition tc
make the ieamer familiar with the language of Xenophon. Accordingly, the chap-
ters and sections in both are made to correspond. No exercises csn be more improv-
lng than those in this volume: obliging the student 88 they do, by analysis and syn·
thesis, to master the constructions employed by one of the pnrest of Greek writers

aad imbuing him with the spirit of one of tho nectent historin· of 811 untiquity.
