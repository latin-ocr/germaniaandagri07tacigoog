office of Quindecimvir and Praetor (Ann. ii. 11). Beyond
these vague notices,. we know little or nothing of his course
of life, except that Pliny says (Epist. iv. 13), he was much
esteemed by the learned and the great at Rome, who went in
crowds to his levees. Of the time of his death, we can only
conjecture, that he died before the Emperor Trajan, but aster
his friend Pliny—the former, because, had he outlived the
Emperor, he would probably have executed his purpose of
writing the history of his reign (His. i. 1) ; the latter, because,
if he had not survived his· friend, Pliny, who lamented the
death of so m'any otherS, would not have failed to pay the last
tribute to the memory of Tacitus.

It is generally admitted, though without direct testimony,
that Tacitus died not without issue. That excellent prinae,
M. Claudius Tacitus, deduced his pedigree from the historiam,
and ordered his image to be set up, and a complete collection
of his works to be placed in the public archives, with a special
direction that twelve copies should be made every year at the
public expense. It is greatly to be regretted that such praise-
worthy precautions should have failed to preserve for us that
treasure- entire!

The age of Tacitus is usually styled the silver age of Roman
Literature3 and it merits no higher title, when compared
with the golden age of Augustus. 1t was the good fortune
of Augustus to gain the supremacy at Rome, when society
had reached its maximum of refinemenss and was just ready to
enter upon its stage of corruption and decline. Hence his

’ name is identified with that proud era in literature, in producing

which he bore at best only an accidental and secondary part.
In the literature of the Augustan age, we admire the substance
of learning and philosophy without the show, the cultivation
ef taste without the parade of criticism, the fascination of poetry
