ind. aster donec, until, cf. Rup. dc Rit. in loc. Whenever he uses
the present after donec, until, he seems to have conceived the rala-
tion of the two clauses, which it connecte, as that of a means to an
end, or a condition to a result, and hence to have used the subj.
cf. chap. 20: separet ‚· 31: absolvat ‚· 35: sinuetur ,· Ann. 2, 6:
misceatur. The two examples last cited, like this, describe the
course of a river and boundary line. For the general rule of the
modes after donec, see Gr. 263, 43 Ζ. 575. See also notes H. 1. 13.
35.—Septimum. According to the common understanding, the
Danube had seven mouths. So StrabO, Mela, Ammian, and Ovid;
Pliny makes six, T. reconciles the two accounts. The enim in·
serted aster septimum in most editions is not found in the best
mss· and is unnecessary. Or. dt Rit„ omit it.

II. Ipsos marks the transition from the country to the people—
the Germane themselves. So A. 13: Ipsi Britanni.

Crediderim. Subj. attice. A modest way of expressing his
opinion, like our: I should say, I am inclined to think. Gr. 260,
R. 4; Ζ. 527.

Adventibus et hospitiis. Immiqrants and visitor-3. Adventibus
certae sedes, hospitiis preregrinationes significantur. Giin. Both
abstract for concrete. Dsd. compares ἔποικοι and μέτοικοι.

Terra-advehebantur. Zeugma for terra adveniebant, classibus
advehebantur. Gr. 323, 1. (2.); Ζ. 775. ,

Nec-et. These coi-relatives connect the members more closely
than et-et3 as in Greek οὔτε-τέ. The sentiment here advanced
touching colonization (as by sea, rather than by land), though true
of Carthage, Sicily, and most Grecian eolonies, is directly the re-
verse of the general faet3 and Germany itself is now known ιο have
received its population by land emigration, from western Asia. The
Germana as we learn from affinities of languages and occasional
references of historians and geographers, belonged to the same great
stock of the human family with the Goths and Scythiam, and may
be traced back to that hive of nations, that primitive residence of
mankind, the country east and south of the Caspian Sea and in the
vicinity of Mount Ararat: cf. Tur. His. Ang. Sax. B. II. O. 1 ; also
Donaldson's New Cratylus, B. Ι. Chap. 4. Latham's dogmatic
skepticism will hardly shake the now established saith on this subject.
The seience of ethnography was unknown to the ancients. Tacitus
had not the remotest idea, that all mankind were sprung from a
, common ancestry, and diffused themselves over the world from a
common centre, a fact asserted in the Scriptures, and daily receiving
