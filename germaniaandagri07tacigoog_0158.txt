and, so far as known to the Romans, the past history of the island.
Tacitus possessed poculiar advantages for being the historian of the
early Britons, His father-in-law was the first to subject the whole
island to the sway of Rome. He traversed the country from south
to north at the head of his armies, explored it with his own eyea
and reported what 110 saw to our author with his own lips. He
saw the Britons too, in their native nobleness, in their primitive love
of liberty and virtue; before they had become the slaves of Roman
arms, the dupes of Roman arts, or the victims of Roman vices, A few
paragraphs in the concise and nervous style of Tacitus, have made us
quite acquainted with the Britons, as Agricola found them; and on
the whole, we have no reason to be ashamed of the primaeval inhab-

prized them, they fought for them bravely and died for them nobly.
More harmony among themselves might have delayed, but could

most sagacious and reflecting of all historians an account, too brief
though it be, of the origin and antiquities of the people that of all
others now exert the widest dominion whether in the political or
the moral world, and that have made those countries which were in
his day shrouded in darkness, the radiant points for the moral and
spiritual illumination of our race. “The child is father to the man,”
and if we would at this day investigate the elementa of English laW,
we have it on the authority of Sir william Blackstone, that we
must trace them back to their founders in the customs of the Britons
and Germans„as recorded by Caesar and Tacitus.

With the retirement of Agricola from the command in Britain,
the author falls back more into the province of biography. The
few occasional strokes, however, in which the pencil of Tacitus
has sketched the character of Domitian in the back ground of the
picture of Agricola are the more to be prized, because his history 01
that reign is lost,

In narrating the closing scenes of Agricola’s life, Tacitus breathes
the very spirit of an affectionate son, without sacrificing the im· ·>
