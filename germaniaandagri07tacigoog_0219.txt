In the preparation of this volume, great care has been taken to adapt it in'every
respect to the wants of the young student, to make it a means at the same tIme oi
advancing him in a thorough knowledge of Latin, and inspiring him with a desire
sor further acquaintance with the classice of the language. Dr. Spencer has not, like

some commentatum, given an abundance ot help on the easy passages, and allowed ·

the difficult ones to speak for themselves. His notes are on those parts on which
the pupil wants them, and explain, not only grammatical difficulties, but allusions 01
every kind in the text. A well-drawn sketch of Oaesar’s lire, a map of the region in
which his campaigns were carried on, and a vocabum-y, thch removes the neces·
Ἰ sity of using a large dictionary and the waste of time consequent thereon‚ enhance
the value ot the volume in no small degree.

Curtius' Histoi-y of Alexander the Great, though little used in the schools oi
this country, in England and on the Continent holds a high place in the estimati on
oi' classical instructors. The interesting character of its subiect, the elegance ot itu
style, and the purity of its moral sentiments, ought to place it at least on a par with
Caesar's Commentaries or Sallust's Histories. The present edition, by the late Pro·
sessor of Latin in Rutgers College, is unexceptionable ln typography‚ convenient in
form, scholarly and practica] in its notes, and altogether an admirable text-book 1oe
classes preparing for college.

From Pnor. Owen, osthe New York Free Academy.

“ It gives me great ¹pleasure to ad d my testimonial to the many you are receiving
in favor or the beautifu and well-edited edition or Quintus Curtius, by Prot. Wm.
Hem-y CrosbK. It is scldom that a'classical book is submitted to me for examina»
tion, to whic 1 can give so hem-ty a recommendation as to this. The external ap-
pearance is attractive3 the papentype, and binding being Just what a text-book
should be, neat, clean, anci durable. The notes are brief, pertinent, scholarlike
neither ton exuberant nor too meagoe, but happily exemplifying the golden men 1
iasii-able end yet so very difficnlt of attainment.” ε
