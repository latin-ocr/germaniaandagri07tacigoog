celeberrimus quisquc. Such ¹men as Pliny the elder, Claudius
Pollio, and Julius Secundus, wrote biographies. Also Rusticus and
Senecio. See chap. 2.

Plerique. Not most persons, but many, or very many. Cf. His.
1, 86, and 4, 84, where it denotes a less number than plures and
plurimi, to which it is allied in its root (ple, ple-us, plus, plerus.
See Freund ad v.)

Suam ipsi vitam. Autobioyraphy. Cic. in his Epist. to Luc-
ceius says: If Ι cannot obtain this favor from you, I shall perhaps
be compelled to write my own biography, multorum exemplo et
clarorum virorum. When ipse is joined to a possessive pronoun in a
reflexive clause, it takes the case of the subject of the clause. Cf.
Ζ 696, Note; Gr. 207, 28.

Fiduciam morum. A mark ⁰f con-scions inteyrity ,· literally
confidence of, i. e. in their morals. Morum is objective gen. For
the two accusatives (one of which however is the clause suam—nar-
rare) after arbitrati eunt, see Z. 3943 Gr. 230. A gen. may take
the place of the latter acc„ esse being understood, Z. 448.

Rutilio. Rutilius Rufus, consul A. U. C. 649, whom Cic. (Brut.
30, 114.) names as a profound scholar in Greek literature and phi-
losophy, and Velleius (2, 13, 2.) calls the best man, not merely of
his own, but of any age. He wrote a Roman history in Greek.
Plut. Mar. 28. His autobiography is mentioned only by Tacitus.

Scauro. M. Aemilius Scaurus, consul A. U. C. 639, who wrote
an autobiography, which Cic. (Brut. 29, 112.) compares favorably
with the Cyropaedia of Xenophon.

Citra fidem. cf. note G. 16.—Aut obtrectationi. Enallage, οἱ
note, G. 15. Render: This in the case os Rutilius and Scaurus did
not impair (public) confidence or incur (public) censure.

Adeo, To such a deyree, or so true it ie. Adeo conclusiva, et
in initio sententiae collocata, ad mediam latinitatem pertinet. Dr.
Livy uses adeo in this way often3 Cic. uses tantum.

At nunc, etc. But now (in our age so different from those better
days) in undertakiny to write (i. e. if I had undertaken to write) the
leffe os a man at the time of his death, I should have needed per-
·mission ; which Ι would not have asked, since in that case I should
have fallen om. times so cruci and hostile to virtue. The reference
is particularly to the time of Domitian, whose jealousy perhaps
