department the works of Prichard and Latham have been
my chief relianoe. Grimm and Zeuss, though often referred
to, Ι regret to say I have been able to consult only at seoond
hand. ,

In sending out this revised edition of these most delight-
ful treatises of xan author, in the study of whose works I
never tire, Ι oannot rbut express the hope, that it has been
not a little improved by these alterations and additions, while
it will be found to have lost none of the essential features
. by which the first edition was commended to so good a
measure of publio favor
