familiarity with the German language and literature, 1 chiefly
relied for its successful accomplishment.

1 should not do justice to my feelingS, were 1 to omit'the
expression of my obligations to the printer and publishers for
the unwearied patience with which they have labored to perfect
the work, under all the disadvantages attending the superin-
tendance of the press, at such a distance. If there should still
be found in it inaccuracies and blemisheS, it will not be because
they have spared any pains to make it a correct and'beautiful
book.

Itis with unfeigned diffidence that I submit to the Public this
first attempt at literary labor. I am fully sensible of its
many imperfectione, at the same time 1 am conscious of an ability
to make it better at some future day, should it meet the favor-
able regard of the classical teachers of our land, to whom it is
dedIcated as an humble contribution to that cause in which
they are now laboring, with such unprecedented zeal. Should
it contribute in any measure to a better understanding, or a
higher appreciation by our youthful countrymen of a classic
author, from whom, beyond almost any other, I have drawn in·
struction and delight, I shall not have labored in vain.
