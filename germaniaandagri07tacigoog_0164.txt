Aomcom. 147

flabia Steals in, lit- creeps under. cf. note, Η. 1, 13.

Invisa primo—amatur. The original perhaps of Pope’s lines
Vice is a monster, dvc.

Quindecim annos. The reign of Domitian from A. D. 81, to
A. D. 96.

Fortuitis casibus. Natural and ordinary death, as opposed to
death by violence, saevitia principis. —- Promptissimus quisque.
The ablest, or all the ablest. Quieqzoe with a superlative, whether
singular or plural, is in general equivalent to omnes with the posi-
tive, with the additional ides however of a reciprocsl comparison
among the persons denoted by quisque. Ζ. ἿΙΟ, 6.

Ut ita dixerim. An apology for the strong expression nostri
ncpemites .· ruminor-s not of othere only, but so to speak, of ourselves
also ; for we can hardly be said to have lived under the tyranny of
Dom.‚ and our present happy life is, as it were, a renewed existence,
aiter being buried for fifteen years. A beautiful conception! The
use of ditm-im in preference to dicam in this formula is character-
istic of the later Latin. Cf. Ζ. 528. The et before this clause is
omitted by some editors. But it is susceptible of sn explanation,
which adds spirit to the passage: A few of us survive, and that not
merely ourselves, but so to speak, others also. In the Augustan age
superstes was, for the most part, followed by the dative.

Tamen„ Notwithstanding the unfavorsble circumstances in
which I write, aster so long a period of desthlike silence, in which
we have almost lost the gift of speech, yet I shall not regret to have
composed even in rude and inde-qaut lanyuaqe, etc. For the con·
struction ofpiqebit, cf. Ζ. 441. 0

Memoriam-composuisse. Supposed to refer to his forthcofning
history, written, or planned and announced‚ but not yet published.
Some understand it of the present treatise. But then interim

' would have no meaning3 nor indeed is the language applicable to

his Aqricola.

Interim, sc. editus or vulgatus, published meanwhile, i. e. while
preparing the history.

The reader cannot but be struck with the beauty of this intro·
duction. It is modest, and at the same time replete with the dignity
of eonscious worth. It is drawn out to considerable length, yet it
is all so pertinent and tssteful, that we would not spsre a sentence
or a word. With all the thoughtful and sententious brevity of the
exordiums of Sallust, it has far more of natural esse and the besutv
of appropriateness.
