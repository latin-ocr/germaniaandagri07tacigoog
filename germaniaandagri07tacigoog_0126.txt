caea, B. G. 6, 21: qui diutissime impuberes permanserunt, maximam
inter suos ferunt laudem.

Viryines festinantur—nuptiae virginum festinantur, poetice. The
words properare, festinare, accelerare are used in both a trans. and
intrans. sense, cf. Hist. 2, 82: festinabantur; 3, 37 ε festinarentur.
Among the Romans, boys of fourteen eontracted marriage with
girls of twelve. Cf. Smith's Dic. Ant.

Eadem, similis, pares. The comparison is between the youth of
the two sexes at the time of marriage3 they marry at the same age,
eqnal in stature and equal in strength. Man-iuges unequal in these
respects, were frequent at Rome.—Pares-miscentur. Plene: pares
paribus, validae validis miscentur. On this kind of brachylogy, see
further in Dod. Essay on style of T.‚ H. p. 15. Miscentur has a
middle sense, as the passive often has, particularly in Tacitus. cf.
note 21. obliyantur.

Referunt. cf. Virg. Aen. 4, 329: pai vulus Aeneas, quite tamen
ore referret. See note, 39: auguriis.

Ad patrem. Ad is often equivalent to apud in the best Latin
authors3 e. g. Cic. ad Att. 10, 16: ad me fuit===apud me fuit.
Rhenanus by conjecture wrote apud patrem to correspond with
apud avunculum. But Passow restored ad with the best reason. For
Τ. prefers d{fferent words and, constructions in antithetic clauses.
Perhaps also a different sense is here intended from that which
would have been expressed by apud. Wr. takes ad in the sense, in

respect to .· asin respect to a father, i. e. as they would have, if he
were their father.

Eoeiyuna sc. hunc nexum—sororum filios.

Tanquam. Like Greek ὥς to denote the views of others, not of
the writer. Hence followed by the subj. Gr. 266, 33 Z. 571.

Et in animum. In===quod attinet ad, in respect to. The com· -
monly received text has ii et animum, which is a mere conjecture
of Rhen. According to K„ teneant has for its subject not sororum
filii, but the same subject as eaeiyunt. Render: Since, as they sup-
pose, both in respect to the mind (the affectione), they hold it more
etronqlffi and in respect to the family, more extensively.

Heredes properly refers to property, successores to rank, though

the distinction is not always observed.—Ist‘beri includes both sons
and daughter&

Patrai, paternal uncles; avunculi, maternal.
Propinqui, blood relations3 affines, by marriage.
Orbitatis pretia. Pretia—proemia. Orbitatis-ckimeuneos
