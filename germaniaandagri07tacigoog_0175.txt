158 nora-s,

aven to Iceland. The account of the island, like that of the m
rounding ocean, is obviously drawn from the imagination.

Nam hactenus, etc. For their orders were to proceed thus far
only, and (besides) winter was approaehiny. Of. hactenus, G. 25,
and appetere, Ann. 4, 51: appetente jam luce. The editions gene-
rally have nix instead of jussum. But Rit. and Or. with reason
follow the oldest and best MSS. in the reading jussum, which with
the slight and obvious amendment of nam for quam by Rit. renders
this obscure and vexed passage at length easy and clear.

Piyrum et yrave. See a similar description of the N orthem
ocean, G. 25: pigrum ac prope immotum. The modern reader
need not be informed‚ that this is an entire mistake, as to the mat-
ter of fact3 those sees about Britain are never frozen3 though the
navigatore in this voyage might easily have magnified the perils and
hardships of their enterprise, by transferring to these waters what
they had heard of those further north.

Perinde. Al. proinde. These two forms are written indiscri-
minately in the old MSS. The meaning of ne perinde here is not
so much, sc. as other seas. cf. note, G. 5.

Ne ventis-attolli. Directly the reverse of the truth. Those
seas, are in fa'ct, remarkably tempestuous.

Quod-impellitur. False philosophy to explain a fictitious phe·
nomenon, as is too often the case with the philosophy of the
ancients‚ who little understood natural science, cf. the astronomy of
T. in 12.

Neque-ae. Coi-relatives. The author assigna two reasons why
he does not discuss the subJect of the tides. · 1. It does not suit the
design of his work; 2. The subject has been treated by many others
eNJgStrab35‚;ll P1in.,‚N.H.299&e.

Multum fluminum. Multum is the object of ferre, of which
mare is the subject, as it is also of all the infinitives m the sentence.
Fluminum is not rivers but currente among the islands along the
shore.

Nec littore tenus, etc. “sse ebbinye and flowinqe of the tide are
not confined to the shore, but the eea penetratee into the beart qs
the country, and works ite way among the hille and mountains, aa
ίη ite native bedl’ Ky. A description very appropriate to a coast
so cut up by aestuaries, and highly poeticaL but wanting in sim-

licity.
