Hoc-vinculum. So, ὁ 13: haec apud illos toga. In both pas·
sagea the allusion is to Roman customs (for which 666 Becker’s
Gallus, Exc. 1. Scene 1). In Germany‚ thece presente take the place
of the confarreatio (666 Fiske's Manual, p. 286. 4. ed.), and the vari-
ous other methods of ratifying the marriage contract at Rome3
these, of the religious rites in which the parties mutually engaged
on the wedding day (see Man„ p. 287).—00nju9ales deoc. Certain

Extra. Cic. would have said expertem or positum extra. But
Γ. is fond of the adv. used elliptically.

Auspiciis—initialem rites.

Denuntiant, proclaim, denota—Accipere depende on denuntiant

Rursus, 'quae-refhrantur. Rhenanus conjectured3 rursusque-re·
ferant, which has since become the common reading. But referantur
is the reading of all the MSS„ and needs no emendation; and quae,
with as good authority as que, makes the construction more natural
and the sense more apposite. The passage, as Gr. well suggests,
consists of two parts (accipere-rethia& and quae-accipiant-referantur),
each of which includes the two ideas of receiviny and handiny down
to the next generation. Render thus: she is reminded that she re-
ceives qesta, which. she is το, hand over pure and uneullied to ker
,children ; which. laer dauyhterc-in-law are to receive ayain (sc. from
her sons, as she did from her husband), which are to be transmitted
by them to her mand-children.

Reserantur. In another writer, we might expect referant to
correspond in construction and subJect with accipiant. But Tacitus
is fond of varying the construction. Cf. Botticher’s LeX. Tac„ and
note, 16: iynorantum.

XIX. Septa. So the MSS. for the most part. Al. septae. Mean-
ing: with chastity quarded, sc. by the saci-educas of marriage and
the excellent institutione of the Germans.
