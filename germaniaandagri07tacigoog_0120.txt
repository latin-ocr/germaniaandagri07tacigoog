he was reading a description of the manner of life among our Ame-
rican Indians. It may be remarked here, once for all, that this re-
semblance may be traced in very many particulam, e. g. in their
personal independence‚ in the military chieftains and their followers‚
in their extreme fondness for the hardships and dangers of war, in
their strange inactivity‚ gluttony and drunkenness in peace, in their
deliberative assemblies and the power of eloquence to sway their
counseh, in their half elective, half hereditary form of government,
in the spirituality of their conceptions of God, and some other fea-
tures of their religion (Robertson has drawn out this comparison in
his history of Charles V). All tribes in a rude and savage state
must have many similar usages and traits of character. And this
resemblance between the well-known habits of our wandering
savages and those which Τ. ascribes to the rude tribes of Germany‚
may impress us with confidence in the truthfulness of his narrative.

Vel armentorum vel sruqum. Partitive gen. Supply aliquid.—·
Vel-vel=whether-or, merely distinctive; aut—aut—either—or, ad-
versative and exclusive. Vel-vel (from υὸἷο) implies, that one may
choose between the alternatives or particulars named; aut—aut (from
αὖ, αὖτις), that if one is affirmed, the other is denied‚ since both
cannot be true at the same time. Cf. note, A. 17 : aut-aut.—
Pecuniam. An oblique censure of the Romans for purchasing
peace and allianoe with the German& cf. H. 4, 7 6. Herodian 6, ‘7 z
τούτῳ γὰρ (sc. χρυσίῳ) μάλιστα Γερμανὸι πείθονται, φιλάργυροί τε

ὄντες καὶ τὴν εἰρήνην ἀεὶ πρὸς τοὺς Ρωμαίους χρυσίου καπηλεύοντες.
On et, cf. note 11.

XVL Populis. Dative of the agent instead of the abl. with
a or ab. Cf. note 3: Ulixi.

Ne-quidem. These words are always separated, the word on
which the emphasis rests being placed between them. Gr. 279, ὃς
Ζ. 301. Here however the emphasis seems to belong to the whole
clause—Inter se, sc. sech-3 junctas inter se.

Colunt—in-colunt. Both often used intransitively, or rather
with an ellipsis of the object—dweu.

Discrcti ac diversi. Separate and scactered in different directions,
i. e. without regular streets or highways. See Or. in loc.

Utsons-placuit. Hence to this day, the names of German towns
often end in bach (brook)‚ feld (field), holz (grove), wald (wood)‚ born
(spring). On the permanence of names of places, see note H. 1, 53.
