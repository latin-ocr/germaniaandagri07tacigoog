annuatim. 125

Tacitus, with all his partiality for German manners and moi-als,
still retains the heart of a Roman patriot. He loves his country
with all her faultS, and bears no good-will to her enemies, however

all was it written for the mere pastime and amusement of Roman
readers. It breathes the spirit at once of the earnest patriot, and the
high· -toned moralist.
