king Prasutagus of his kingdom and his palme, Ann. 14, 31, which
is the best commentary on the passage before us.

Ab iynavis. By the feeble and cowardly. Antithetic to sor·
tior-em. In battle, it is the braver that plunders ειη but now (it is
a special aggravation of our sufferings, that) by the feeble and eow-
arAEy, dte. So in contempt, they call the veterans, cf. 14: vete-
ranorum colonien 32: senum colonia.

Tantum limits pro patria ,· as if it was for their country only
they knew not how to die.

Si sese, etc, i. e. in oomparison with their own numbers.

Patriam-parentes, sc. causas belli esse.

Recessisset. Observe the subj. in the subordinate clauses of the
oratio obliqua throughout this chapter. Gr. 266, 2: Ζ. 603.

Νευε-Ραυοκεταηι. This verb would have been an imperative in
the oratio recta, Z. 603, c. Neve is appropriate either ’ω the imp.
or the subj.

XVL Instincti, i. e. furore quodam afflati. Dr. For a fuller
account of this revolt, see Anu. 14, 31-38; Dic. 62, 1-13.

Boudicca. Wife of Prasutagus, king of the Iceni. When con-
quered, she ended her life by poison, Ann. 14, 3⁷.

Expuqnatis praesidiis. Haviny stormed the forti-esses. The
force of ex in this word is seen in that it denotes the actual
carrying of a place by assault, whereas oppuqnatus only denotes
the assault itself. So ἐκ-πολιορκηθείς-ίαῖεεπ in a siege, πολιορκηθείς
—besieged

Ipsam coloniam. Cf. note 14: veteranorum colonia.

In barbaria—qualis inter barbaros esse solet. R. Exc. 25.

Ira et victoria. Hendiadys. Render: Nor did they in the ex-
citement qf victory omit, etc. So Dr. R. and Wr. Ira may, how·
ever, refer to their lony cherished resentment. Ira causam, victoria
facultatem explendae saevitiae denotat. Bit—Quod nisi. Ana
hadnot, etc. Cf. note, 12: quoda:

Patientias. Most Latin authors would have said: ad patien-
tiam. R. Patientia here—submissiora

fluentibus—plerisque. Tltouyh many still retained, i. e. did not
lay down their ama.

Propius. Al. proprius. But that is purely conjectural. Adv.
for adj„ cf. ultra, 8; longe, 6—propior‚ like the propior cura 01
ovid. Metamor. 13, 57 8. Render: a more uryent sear: Some
would connect propius with ayitabat notwithstanding its remoto

position.
