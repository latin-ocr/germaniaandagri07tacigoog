Ier. Harkness' work will not make mom Latin students, it will at least make
Utor-ouon ones. It seems better adapted to introduce a student to Cicero than any
other work, and might, perhaps, be useihlly substituted in the room of Caesar and

Harkness' Second Latin Book has completed the work which his First so admi·
rably begam—the development or a lucid and truly philosophical method orintto·
ducing the young pupil to the knowledge of the Latin. Such a work has hitherto
been a desideratum. With these books, 1 conceive that the toacher will desire
nothing more to cover the same ground.

From Pnor. Humi«, osche Univereity osMichioan..

1 admire in this book the perspicuity and natural order of the rules, its correct·
ness, sufficient rulness, and Medum from redundancy‚ and, at the same time, its
beautiful typography. 1 am sully convinced that a faithful use of the First and
Second Latin Books will place the pupil securely on ssis right nack, and facilium,
more than any other elementary treatises with which 1 am acquainted‚ his thorough
understanding of the language.

1 heartily wish that all studente preparing sor this college would stndy both books
thoronghiy.

From Paor. mansore, quewisburo Universim Pa.

1 am happy to be able to express my high gratification‚ both with the plan and
the execution or the work. The simplieity‚ yet thoroughness, with wh1ch each suc·
cessive grammatical point is treated, peculiarly adapts it for-those who are striving to
master both the form and the spirit or the lang-uage. A faithful use oi' the work
would diminish the drudgery of the student’s earlier studies, and facilitate his progress
in his subsequent course. 1 wish the work a wide circulation.

From A. P. S. Smanr, Principal osche Holten ΗὶοῙι School, N. Danvers, Mass

Your Second Latin Book is what 1 was prepared to expect from the character or
your First Book—s lucid development os the structute of the Latin sentence, em·
bracing at once what is sufficient, and yet no more than isnecessary to give the pupil
a clear and comprehensive view of the structure or the language. 1 shall recommend
its introduction into my school.

1 have examined your Second Latin Book with care, and beg to say that Ι regard
it as a valuable contribution to the cause of sonnd classical learning. Iu the Latin text,
and in the Exereises in Grammatical Analysis which it contains, it is an admitsble
introduction to the study of the classic authors.

t have examined the Second Latin Book just published by the Messrs. Applewn,
with much caro and great pleasure. 1 like its plan, —the anion osReadina Les-som
ln Latin with Eoeeroiees in the analysis and reconstruction of Latin sentences, aad
in translations from English into Latin. It is the true way of teaching Latin.
The Exercises are remarkable ror their simplicity and clearness, and lead on th·
scholar step by step from first principles in their simplest forms to their more compli-
ested combinations in a manner most thorough and easily comprehended, till th·
went structure of the Latin language is cedually wrought out before him.
