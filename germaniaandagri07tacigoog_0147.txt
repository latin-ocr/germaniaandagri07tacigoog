Triumphati. Poetioe, σε Virg. Aen. e, 837: Triumphum 00-
rintho; Hor. Od. 3, 3, 43: Triumphati Medi. The reference here is
o the ridiculous triumph of Domitian, A. 39, in which slaves, pur-

⁰ chased and dressed out for the purpose, were borne as captives

through the streete.

XXXVIII. Saeuis. In the time of T. a powerful confederacy,
embracing all the tribes enumerated in 39—45, and covering all the
eastern and larger half of Germany. But the confederacy was soon
dissolved and seldom appears in subsequent history. We still have
a traee of their name in the Modern Suabia. The name is supposed
by some philologists (e. g. Zeuss) to denote unsettled wanderers
(Germ. Schweben, to wave, to hover, cf. Caes. B. G. 4, 1: Suevis
non longius anno remanere uno in loce, etc.); as that of the Saxons
does settlers, or fiaeed residente (Germ. Sassen), and that of the Franks,
freemen. See Rup. in loc. An ingenious Article in the North Ame-
rican Review (July‚ 1847), makes the distinction of Suevi and non-
Suevi radical and permanent in the religion and the language of
the Germans3 the Suevi becoming Orthodox Catholics, and the non-
Suevi Arians in Ecclesiastical History, and the one High-Dutch and
the other Low-Dutch in the development of their language.

Adhuc. Cf. note on it, 19. As to position, cf. insuper 31, and
34. The Suevi are still (adhuc) divided into distinct tribes bearing
distinct names, though united in a confederacy. Gf. Hand’s Tmsel-
linus‚ 1, 163. Ded„ renders besides, sc. the general designation of
Suevi.

In commune. In common. Not used in this sense by Oia.. Caes.
and Liv, though frequent in T. Gr. Cf. note on the same, 27.

Obliquare. To turn the hair back, or comb it up contrary to its
natural direction—and then fasten it in a knot on the top of the
head (substringere nodo) ; so it seems to be explained by the author
himself below: horrentem capillum retro sequuntur ae in ipso solo
vertice religant. Others translate obliquare by twist. Many ancient
writers speak of this manner of tying the hair among the Germans,
cf. Seu. de Ira. 3, 26.; Juv. 13, 164.

A servis separantur. Separantur=distinguuntun Sel-vanus
among the Suevi seem to have had their hair shorn. so also it was
among the Franks at a later date. Vid. Greg. Tur. 3, 8.

Rarum et intra, etc. Enallage, cf. note eertum quique, 32.

Retro sequuntur, i. e. follow it back, as it were, in its growth,
‚and tie it up on the very eroum of the head only, instead of letting it
hang down, as it grows (submittere crinem). So Κ.. Or. and manv
