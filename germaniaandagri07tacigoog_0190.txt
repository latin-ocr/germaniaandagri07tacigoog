were so narrow as to require it), aswell as the narrowisthmus,
was occupied and secured (tenebatur) by garrisons.

XXIV. Nave prima. The first Roman. skip that ever visited
those shores. So Br., Dr„ etc. ste foremost skip, sc„ A. himself,
followed by others in a line. So Ritter. Wr., and some others under·
stand it of a voyage from Rome, where they suppose him to have
passed the winter, and whence he erossed over to Britain by the
earliest vessel in the spring. W. and R. make prima equivalent to'
an adv. and render: crossing over sor the first time by ship. Or.
also makes prima—tum primum.

Gopiis. Here troops with their equipments—forcee, cf. 8: maj0-
ribus copiis—Medio sita lying between, not midway between. E.
—In spem-somnidinem. More with the hope of invading Ireland,
than through sear of invasion by the Irish.— Valentissimam partem,
viz· Gaul, Spain and Britain.

Misctaerit. The subj. here denotes the aim or purpose of the
projector: it would have done so in Ιιίε view.

Invicem—an adj. mutua—*Nostri maris. The Mediterranean.

Differ-unt .· in m’elius. The authorities differ greatly as to the
reading, ,the pointing and the interpretation of this passage. Some
copies omit in. Others insert nec before it. Some place the pause
before in melius, others after. Some read differt, others differunt.
Nec in melius would perhaps give the better sense. But the read·
ing is purely conjectural I have given that, which, on the whole,
seems to rest on the best authority, and to make the best sense.
The sense is: the soil, climate, dte„ do not differ much from those
of Britain. But that the harbors and entranees to tlae country are
better (lit. differ for the better, di erre in melius), is ascertained
throuqlz the medium of the merchant-5, who resort thither for trade
(for Ireland had not yet, like Britain, been explored by a Roman
(ιτ-ηιμ). So Wr. and Ded. On in melius, see note H. 1, 18. Or. and
Rit. make the comparison thus: the harbors and entrances are
better known, than the soil, climate, dte. The common interpreta-
tion is: the harbors, dte„ of Ireland are better known, than those
of Britain. But neither of these interpretatione accounts for the
position of melius ,· and the last is in itself utterly incredible.

Ex eo, sc. A. Pass. and Dr. understand it of the Irish chief, and
infer that T. had been in Brit. But A. is the subject of the next
sentence without the repetition of his name, as it would have been
repeated, if this sentence referred to another.
