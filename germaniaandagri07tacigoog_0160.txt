1118 simple facts of 1118 narrative. Every thing produces attachment;
every 1111113 conveys instruction. The reader loves Agricola, admires
him, conceives a passion for him, accompanies him 111 1118 campaigns,
ahares 111 1118 disgrace and profits by his example. The interest goes
on growing to the last. And when it seems incapable of further
increase, passages pathetic and sublime transport the soul out of

obstr-actions. Sal. (J ug. 5) uses it for in open day, or clear light. But
that sense would be inappropriate here. Easy. Not essentially
different from pronum, which properly means inclined, and hence
easy. These two words are brought together in like manner in
other passages of our author, cfi 33: vota virtusque in aperto, om-
niaque prona victoribus. An inelegant imitation may be thus ex·
pressed 111 English· down -hill and open-ground work.

Sine qratia aut ambitione. thmt com-cinq favor or see-huy
prefer-ment. Gratia properly refers more to the present, ambitio
10 1118 future. cf. Ann. 6, 46: Tiberio non perinde gratia praesen·
tium, quam in posteros ambitio. Ambitio is here used in a bad
