The author does indeed, in the passage just cited, seem to appre
ciate with almost prophetie accuracy, those dangers to the Roman
Empire, which were so fearfully illustrated in its subsequent fall be·
neath the power of the German Tribes ; and he utters, as what true
Roman would not in such forebodings, the warnings and the pray-
ers of a patriot sage. But he does this only in episodes‚ which are
so manifestly incidental, and yet arise so’naturally out of the narra·
tive or description, that it is truly surprising it should ever have oc-
curred to any reader, to seek in them the key to the whole treatise.

The entire warp and woof of the work is obviously histori-
σαί and yeoyraphical. The satire, the politica] maxims, the moral
sentimenta, and all the rest, are merely incidental, interwoven for
the sake of instruction and embellishment, inwrought because a mind
so thoughtful and so acute as that of Tacitus, could not leave them
out.. Tacitus had long been collecting the materiale sor his Roman
Histories. In so doing, his attention was necessarily drawn often
and with special interest to a people, who, for two centurias and
more, had been the most formidable enemy of the Roman State. In
introducing them into his history, he would naturally wish to give
some preliminary account of their origin, manners, and institutione,
as he does in introducing the Jews in the Fifth Book of his Histories,

which happens to be, in part, preserved. N or would it be strange,
if he should, with this view, collect a mass of materials, which he
could not incorporate entire into a work of such compass, and which
any slight occasion might induce him to publish in a separate form,
perhaps as a sort of forerunner to his Historiea* Such an occasion
now was furnished in the campaigns and victories of Trajan, who,
at the time of his elevation to the imperial power, was at the head
of the Roman armies in Germany‚ where he also remained for a year
or more after his accession to the throne, till he had received the sub·
mission of the hostile tribes and wiped away the di e which the
Germane, beyond any other nation of that age, h brought upon
the Roman arms. Such a people, at such a time, could not fail to be

been the motives and the circumstances, which led to the under-
taking. His grand object was not to point a satire or to compass a
