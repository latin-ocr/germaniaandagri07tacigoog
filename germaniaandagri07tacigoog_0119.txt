In the chieftains and their retainers‚ as described in the last
two sections, the reader cannot fail to discover the germ of the
feudal system. Of. Montesq. Sp. of Iaws, 30, 3, 43 also Robertson’ s

XV. Non multum. The common reading (multum without
the negative) is a mere conjecture, and that suggested by a misap-
prehension of the meaning of T. Non multum is to be taken com·
paratively. Though in time of peace they hunt often, yet they
spend ao much more time in eatiny, drinkiny, and sleepiny, that the
former is comparatively small. Thus understood, tnis passage of
T. is not inconsistent with the declaratione of Caesar, B. G. 6, 21;
Vita Germanorum omnis in venationibus atque in studiis rei mili-
taris consistit. Caesar leaves out of account their periods of inac-
tion, and speaks only of their active employments, which were war
and the chase. It was the special object of Tacitus, on the contrary,
to give prominence to that striking feature of the German character
which Caesar evei-looks ; and therein, as Wr. well observes, the
later historian shows his more exact acquaintance with the Germane.
Non multum, as opposed to plus, is nearly equivalent to minus.

Venatibus‚ per otium. Enallagc for venatibus, otio, Gr. 323, 3.
This figure is very frequent in T., e. g. ᾗ 40: per obsequium,
proel=is; A. 9: virtute aut per artem; A. 41: temeritate aut per
ignaviam, dvc. Seneca, and indeed most Latin authors, prefer a
similar construction in antithetic clauses; T. seems rather to
avoid it. In all such cases however, as the examples just cited
show, per with the acc. is not precisely equivalent to the abl. The
abl. is more active and implies means, agency; the acc. with per
is more passive and denotes manner or occasion.

Deleyata, transferred.

Familiae. Household, properly of servants (from famel, Oscan
for servant), as in chapp. 25 and 32: but sometimes the whole
family, as here and in chap. ‘I ε familiae et propinquitates.

Diversitate. Contrariety.—Ament. Subj. Gr. 263, 6; Ζ. 5¹7⁷.-

Inertiam Inertiammidlenem freedom from business and care
(from ἴη and ars) ; quietem==tranquillity, a life of undisturbed re·

this account of the habits of the Germans, one might easily fancy,
