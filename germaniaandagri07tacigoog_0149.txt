Adjicit auctoritatem, sc. isti superstitioni.

Mayno corpore=reipublicae magnitudine. Corpore, the body
politic. So His. 4, 64: redisse vos in corpus nomenque Germano-
rum—Habitantur. Al. habitant and habitantium, by conjecture.
The subject is the Semnonian country implied in Semnonum : the
Semnoniam inhabit a hundred village& is the idea.

XL Lanyobardos. The Lombards of Mediaeval history; so
called probably from their long beards (Germ. lang and bart). First
mentioned by Velleius, 2, 106: gens etiam Germana feritate ferocior.
See also Ann. 2, 45. 46. 62-64.—Paucitas here stands opposed to
the mayno empore of the Semnones in 39.

Per-periclitando. Three different constructions, cf. notes 16. 18.

Reudigni. Perhaps the J utes, so intimately associated wath the
Angles in subsequent history. See Or. in loc. In like manner,
Zeuss identifies the Suardones with the Heruli, and the Nuithones
with the Teutones. Suardonec perhaps—sword-men.

Anylii. Τὶιο English reader will here recognize the tribe of
Germane that subsequently invaded, peopled, and gave name to
England (—An9l-land), commonly designated as the Anglo-Saxons.

and others, as originally occupying a territory in this same part of
Germany. They became at length so powerful, as to give their

northern Germany, as the Franks (the founders of the French
monarchy) did southern. The Angles seem to have dwelt on the
right bank of the Elbe, near its mouth, in the time of T.

Nerthum. This is the reading of the MSS. and the old editions.
It cannot be doubted that T. speaks of Hei-tha (see Turn. His. Ang.

rect our author himself.” Passow. Grimm identifies this deity
with Nifirdln· of the Edda, and derives the name from N ord
(North).—Terram matrem. The Earth is worshipped by almost all
heathen nations‚ as the mother of men and the inferior gods. See
Mur. in 1000. Cf. 2: Tuisconem Deum, terra editum3 also note, 9·

Insula. Scholars differ as to the Island. Probabilities perhaps
are in favor of Rugen‚ where the secretus lacus mentioned below in
still shown, still associated with superstitious legende.

Castum. Polluted by nothing! profane. So Hor: castis lucu.
