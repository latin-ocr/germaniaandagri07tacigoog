Aomcom. 177

with the connexion and spirit of the speech, to take sinus famae in
the sense, retreat of ylory, or ‚qloa‘rInds retreat. So Wr. His inter·
pretation of the passage and its connexion is as follows: our very
remotenees and our qim-imas retreat have quar-ded us till thie day.
But now the fur-theat eoetremity of Brit. is laid open (i. e. our retreat
is no longer a safeguard); and every thirty unknown ie esteemed ¹‹Ji-eat
(ἰ. 0. this safeguard also is removed—the Romans in our midst no
longer magnify our strength). Rit. encloses the clause in brackets,

as a gloss. He renders senus famae bosom of fame, fame being per·
sonified as a goddess, R„ Dr„ Or. make famae dative after defendit .

—has kept back from fame.

Sed nialla jam, etc. But now all the above grounds of confi-
dence-our remoteness, our glory, our greatness magnifieri by the
imagination of our enemies‚ from the very fact that we were un-

Opes atque inopiam. Abs. for cone—rich and poor nations.

Falsis nomin-ibus is by some connected with rapere. But better
with appellant. They call thinye by false names, viz. pluvida-⁹, em-
pire; and desolation, peace.

XXXI. Annos—annonam, yearly produce, cf. G. 14: expectare
annum. So often' 111 the Poets—In frumentum. For supplies. The
reading of this clause 1s much disputed. The text follows that of
W. and R. and is approved by Freund. For the meaning of
eyerunt, cf. praedam eyesse‘mnt, H. 3, 33.

Silvis-emuniendio—viis per silvas et paludes muniendis. E.

Semel. Once sor all, G. 19. — Emit, sc. tributis pendendis·
pascit, sc. frumento praebendo. Ε.

- Portae, quum exercendis. W. and Dr. explain this of collecting
revenue at the ports (i. e. farming them), a thing unknown to the
early Britons ; Wr. of rowing, servile labor. Why not refer it 10
