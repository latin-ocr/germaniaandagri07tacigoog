GERMANIA.

 

'rma Treatisc DE Srw, Momus m· Poruus Glmmmmz, was written
(as appears from the treatise itself, sec 537) in the second consulship
of the Emperor Trajan, Α. U. O. 851, Α. D. 98. The design of the
author in its publication has boen variously interpreted. From the
censure which it frequently passes upon the corruption and degen-
eracy of the times it has been considered as a mere satire upon Ro·
man manners, in the age of Tacitus. But to say nothing of the ill
adaptation of the whole plan to a satirical work, there are large
parts of the treatise, which must have been prepared with great la-
bor, and yet can have no possible bearing on such a design. Satires
are not wont to abound in historica] notices and geographica] details,
especially touching a foreign and distant land.

The same objection lies against the political ends, which have
been imputed to the author, such as the persuading of Trajan to en-
gage, or not to ongage, in a war with the Germane, as the most po-
tent and dangerous enemy of Rome. For both these aims have been
alleged, and we might content ourselves with placing the one as an
offset against the other. But aside from the neutralizing force of such
contradictione, wherefore such an imposing array of geographical re·
search, of historica] lore, of politica] and moral philosophy, for the
accomplishment of so simple a purpose? And why is the purpose
so scrupulously concealed, that confessedly it can be gathered only
from obscure intimations, and those of ambiguous import? Resides,
there are passages whose tendency must have been directly oounter
to eithei of these alleged aims (cf. note ᾗ 38).
