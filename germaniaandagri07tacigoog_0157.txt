the application of the epithet 111 question, was not a matter 01
necessity or of universal practice. Its omission in this case might
have been accidental, or might have proceeded from 'unknown rea-
sons. And the bare absence of a single word surely cannot be
entitled to much weight, in comparison with the obvious and
almost necessary import of the passages just cited.

The primary object of the work is sufficiently obvious. It was
to honor the memory of the writer’s excellent father-indam Agricola
(cf. ᾗ 3: honori Agricolae, mei soceri, destinatus). So far from
apologizing for writing the life of so near a friend, he feels assured
that his motives will be appreciated and his desigu approved, how-
ever imperfect may be its execution; and he deems 611 apology neces·
sary for having so long delayed the performance of that filial duty.
After an introduction of singular beauty and appropriateness (cf.-
notes), 116 sketehes a brief outline of the parentage, education, and
early life of Agricola, but draws out more at length the history of his
consulship and command 111 Britain, of which the following sum·
mary, from Hume’s History of England, may not be unprofitable to

victorious arms northward ; defeated the Britons in every encounter,
pierced into the forests and the mountains of Caledonia, reduced
every state to· subjection in the southern parts of the island, and
chased before him all the men of fiercer and more intractable spirits,
who dcemed war and d'eath itself less intolerable than servitude
under the victors. He defeated them 111 6 decisive action which
they fought under Galgacus3 and having fixed a chain of garrisons
between the friths of Clyde and Forth,he 6111. off the ruder and more
barren parts of the island and secured the Roman province from
the incursione of the more barbarous inhabitants. During these
military enterprises, he neglected not the arts of peace. He intro-
duced laws and civility among the Britons; taught them to desire
and raise all the conveniences of life; reconciled them to the Ro-
man language and manners; instructed them in letters and seience;
and employed every expedient to render those chains which
116 had forged both easy and agreeable to them.” (His. of Eng.
vol. 1.)

The history of Agricola during this period is of course th« his-
tory of Britain. Accordingly the author prefaces it with an outline
of the geographical features, the situation, soil, climate, productione
