infantry, and, as the Romans advanced, became entangled with
them. This is disputed. But the small number of Romans slain in
the whole battle is alone enough to show, that their cavalry was

enemy. Moreover, how could T. properly use the word hostium of
his own countrymeni

Minimeque, etc. This is one passage, among a few in T., which
is so manifestly corrupt that no sense can be made of it, as it stands

⁸ in the MSS. The reading given in the text is the simplest of all the

conjectura] readings that have been proposed. 11, is §hat of Br. and
Ε, and is followed by the common editions. Cavalry took a large
part in the battle. But the battle wore little the aspect of an
equestrian fight3 for the Britons‚ after maintaining their position

Praestare terya is an expression found only in Τ.

Et aliquanda etc. Et==ac tamen. And yet (notwithstanding
the flight of crowds and the passive death of some as above) some-
times to the conquered also there was anyer and bravery. The
language is Virgilian, cf. Aen. 2, 367.

who was everywhere present, caused some strong and lightly equip-
ped cohorts to encompass the ground, while part of the cavalry
having dismounted, made their way through the thickets, and part
on horseback scoured the open woods, some disaster would have
