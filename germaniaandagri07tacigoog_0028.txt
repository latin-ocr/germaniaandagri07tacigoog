soft and delicate finish despised. We feel, that we have gained
not a little insight into the character of those men, who are
barely introduced in the extant books of TacituS, but whose
history is given 'in the books that are lost. Men of inferior
rank even, who appear on the stage only for a short time,
develope strongly marked charactere, which are drawn ⁴with
dramatic distinctness and power, while yet the thread of history
is never broken, the dignity of history never sacrificed. And
those Emperors, whose history is preserved entire,—with them
we feel acquainted‚ we know the conti-olling principles, as well
as the leading events of their lives, and we feel sure that we
could predict how they would act, under almost any imaginable
circumstances·

In a faithful portraiture of the private and public life of the
degenerate Romans, there was much to call for the hand of a
master in satire. And we find in the glowing sketches of our
author, all the vigor and point of a Juvenal, without his vulgarity
and obscenity3 all the burning indignation which the Latin is
so peculial-ly capable of expressing, with all the vigor and
stateliness by which the same language is equally characterized.
Tacitus has been sometimes represented as a very Diogenes,
for carping ’ and sarcasm—-a very Aristophanes, to blacken
character with ridicule and reproach. But he is as far removed
from the cynic or the buffoon, as from the panegyrist or the
fiatterer. He is not the indiscriminate admirer that Plutarch
was. Nor is he such a universal hater as Sanust„ It is the ’
fault of the times that he is obliged to deal so much in censure.
If there ever were perfect monsters on earth, such were several
of the Roman Emperors, Yet Tacitus describes few, if any,
of them without some of the traits of humanity. He gives us
in his history neither demons nor gods, but veritable men and
women. In this respect, as also in his descriptione of baulos. ¹
