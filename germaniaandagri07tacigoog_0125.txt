108 noras.

Ultra, 66. pirmum maritum. So the ellipsis might be supplied.
Ultra here is equivalent to lonqior in the next clause, as T. often
puts the adverb in place of the adjective, whether qualifying ox

redicate.
P Ne tanquam-ament, sc. maritum: that they may not love a hus·
band merely as a husband but as they love the mam-iad state. See
this and similar examples of brachyloyy well illustratsd in Deder-
lein's Essay on the style of Tacitus, Η. p. 14. Since but one marriage
was allowed, all their love for the married state must be concen-
trated in one husband.

- Numam-finire. In any way contrary to nature and by design.
Gan. Quodfiebat etiam abortus procuratione. K.

Ex aquatis. Aynati hoc loeo dicuntur, qui post familiam con·
scindam, ubi haeres jam est, deinde nascuntur. Hess. To put such
to death was a barbarous custom among the Romans. Cf. Ann. 3.
253 see Beck. Gall. Exc. 2. scene 1. ’

Alibi. 6. g. at Rome—Boni mores vs. bonae loyes. These words
involve a sentiment of great importance, and of universal applica-
tion. Good habits wherever they exist, and especially in a republic,
are of far greater value and efficacy than good laws.

XX. Nudi. Cf. 6: nudi aut sagulo leves, Not literally naked,
but slightly clad, cf. Seu. de benef. 5, 13: qui male vestitum et pan-
nosum vidit, nudum 66 vidisse dicit.

Sordidi. Giin. understands this of personal filth. But this is
inconsistent with the daily practice of bathing mentioned, § 22. It
doubtless refers to the dress, 66 Gr. and K. understand it: nudi a«.
sordidi—poorly and meanly elad. So also Or.

Quae miramur. Cf. 4: magna corpora. See also Caes. B. G. 1,
39. 4, 1. 011 haec, see note, 3: haec quoque.

Ano-illis ac, nutricibus.. So in the Dial. de Clar. Orat, T. ani·
madverte upon the custom here obliquely censured: nunc natus
infans delegatur Graeculae alicui ancillae. In the early ages of
Roman History it was not so, see Becker’s Gall. Exc. 2. 666116 1.-
Deleyantur. Deleyamua quum, quod ipsi facere debebamus, id per
alterum fieri curamus. Ε.

Separet. For the use of the subj. pres. aster donec, see note, 1 t
emmpat.—A9no⁸cat=faciat ut agnoscatur. So Ded„ Giin. and K.
But it is better with Gn, to regard the expression as poetical, and
virtus, 66 personified: and valor acknowledqe them, 66. 66 brave
men and therefore by implication free born.

Venus-:concubitus—Pubertas-facultas generandi. Gra Ὺ Of.
