Quod si. And if, now ist—Habitum. Personat appearance, οἱ

G· {comior quam sublimior. Well proportioned, ratker than

tall. R.

Nihil mettas. Nothiny to inspiro sear in his countenance.
Antith. to qratia-supererat .· kindness of expression ratker prevailed.
So Gr. and R. For this sense of metus, see note G. 2: ob metum.
Dod. distinguishes between vultus and oris, making the former refer
more to the eyes (as if from volvo, the rolling of the eye), to which

atque abundantiae. Al. non contigerant. But considerable pro-
perty is implied in -tha circumstances attending his will, 43, also
in his not asking the usual salary, 42. Dion Cass says, however,
(66, 20.), that A. spent his last days in want, as well as in disgrace.
For another explanation of gaudebat, cf. n. G. 5.
