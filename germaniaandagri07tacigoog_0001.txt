Perkins' Arithmetical Series

Embraces four text-books, which cover the whole ground, from the
first lesson of the beginner in counting, to the most abstruse and
intricate operatione embraced in the science. Their distinguishing
features, as a whole, and the points on which their claim to supe-

riority rests, are as follows ε

1. They are complete. Nothing connected with the sub-

jectis omitted. .
2. Each number follows that which precedes lt naturally
ωέῗῗὲἔγ are consistent with each other. s

4. They are philosophIcally arranged. The easier parts
take precedence of the more difficult3 and nothing is antici·
pated to the bewilderment of the pupil.

5. They are inductive. General laws are deduced from in·

dlvldual cases.
6. They are practlcal, constructed with direct reference

to the wants of the pupil when he shall enter on the actual
business of life.

7. Rules and explanations are given tersely. Their point
is not lost in a mass of words.

8. The examples‚ particularly those given first under the
mles, do not involve tedious operatione.

9. Each rule is illustrated by every variety of example
that can fan under it.

10. The examples are so constructed as to require thought
on the part of the pupil.

n. A principle once taught is not allowed to be forgotten.
In one form or other it is made the subject of constant re·
view.
