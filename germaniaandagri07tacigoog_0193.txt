XXIX. Initio aestatis, 1. e. in the beginning of the next sum·
mer (the 'zth campaign, cf. 25: aestate, qua sextum, eta), as the
whole history shows. See especially proximo anno, 34. Hence the
propriety of commencing a new section here. The common editions
begin it below: Iqitun etc.

Plerique. cf. note on it, 1.—Fortium virorum. Military
men.

Ambitiosa with affected fortitude, stoically.—Rursue·-contra, on
the contrary, showing the antith. be ween ambitiose and per lamenta
—Per lamenta, cf. 6: per caritatem—Iyitur, cf. 13, note.

Quae-faceretn—ut ea faceret. Gr. 264, 5; Ζ. 567.

Incertum is explained by pluribus locis. Render: ycncral alar-m.

—Montem Grampium. Now Grampian hills.

virtutem bellicam accepta. E. Any and all badqes of distinction,
especially in arms. Wr., Or. and Ded.

XXX. Causas belli. Explained by universi servitutis expertes

necessitatem is explained by nullae ultra terrae .· there is no retreat
· for us, etc—Animus. Confidence.

Proelium-arma. T. has a passion for pairs of words, especially
nouns, of kindred siqnification. See examples in Index to His-
tories; and in this chapter, spem ac subsidium ,· recessus ac cinus ;

de reserve, or last resource.

Tmarum-extremos. The remote-et of men and last os freemm.
—Recescm—samae. Our very remoeeness and obscurity. This is
