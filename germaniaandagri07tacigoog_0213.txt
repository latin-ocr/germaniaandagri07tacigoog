Tms work 1s designed as a sequel to the author’s “Fnzsr Lam!
Booxss’ recently published‚ and has already acquired a wide repu-
tation. It comprises a complete analytieal syntax, exhibiting the
sentential structure of the Latin language, from its simplest to its
most expanded and modified form.

The arrangement of the lessons is decidedly philosophical‚ gradu
ally progressive, and we believe in striet accordance with the law of
development of the human mind. Every new principle 1s stated m
simple, clear and accurate language, and illustrated by examples care·
fully selected from the reading lessons which the student is required
to translate, analyze and reconstruct-he is also exercised in forming
new Latin sentences on given models. This, while it gives variety
and interest to what would otherwise be in the highest degree mono-
tonoua, completely fixes in the mind the subject of the lesson both by
analyais and synthesis.

From W. S. Turn, Professor osLanauaoee in Amherst Goeleon.

Among the chief merlts ot Harkness' Second Book are the following:

1. It happssy unitos the analytic and the synthetic methods, and requires the pupss
to turn Latin into English, and also English into Latin, in every lesson. N either of
these methods is complete without the other.

2. It points out, with clearness and correctness, the differences between the two
hugunges ss to idiom, construction, δια, and toaches the scholar at once ιο uso
idiomatdc Enalieh, and to write pure Latin.

8. The Bules for Translating are concise, perspicuous and jndicious—well schem
md well expressed. The editor tcaches by example, also, s nest and fico. but no·
oceo cr inexact style of translation.
