4. 'l'he analysls of the structure of sentences is eminently phil.sophical and ⁸1
the same time sufficiently simple and intelligible for beginners. This is one ot the
most striking excellencies of the book.

5. The notes furnish the right kind of guidance and assistance, showing the stu·
dent what to do and how to do it, but not doing it for him.

1 am so well pleased with the book, that Ι shall put my own boy into it, and 1
predict for it unusual success.

1 am happy to express to you my high sense of the value of Prot Harkness' labore
ln the cause of classical learning, especially in the Elementary Latin books which he
has edited for your publishing house. His “Second Latin Book'' gives abundant
evidence of his learning, and tact to arrange, simplify, and make accessible to the
youthful mind the great and fundamental principles of the Latin language. The book
{s worthy of a place in every classical school, and 1 trust will have an extensive sale.
From the Rev. J. A. Sensum² D. D., late Professor of Latin (md Orienlal Lam-

quaqes in Burlinoton Colleoe, Now Jersey.

1 have given some attention to the “Second Latin Book '’ of Mr. Harkness, and
am happy to find it all that the public had reason to expect from the high reputation
acquired by Mr. H.'s previous labors. The present volume appears to me to carry
out excellently the system on which tho late lamented Arnold based his educatioual
works3 and in the Selections for Reading, the Notes and Rules for Translating, the
Exercises in Translating into Latin, the Analysea &c.‚ Ι think it admirably adapted
to advance the diligent student, not only rapidly but soundly, in an acquaIntance
with the Latin language.

From Dn. CAswnm„ Reqont osBrown Unmreity.
Accept my very sincere thanks for the copy of ‘⁴ Harkness' Second Latin Book‚”
. which you har] the kindncss to send me. Ι have looked it over so sar as to be satisfied
that it will be a very userul book.

From Psor. Grumum, osBrown University.
The examination has led me to form a most favorable estimato of the plan of the
work, and also ofthe manner inwhich it has been executed. The book seems to me,
as Ι anticipated it would be, 8 valuable addition to the works now iu use among

teachers of Latin in the schools of the United States, and for many orthem it will
undoubtedly form an advantageous substitute.

From Pnor. meonrz, of Brown Univereity.

Ι have examined with great satisfaction the copy 01· Harkness’ Second Latin
Book. It seems to me to carry on most successfully the method pursued in the Flrsi
Book. Though brief, it is very comprehensive, and combines judicious and skilfully
formed exercises with systematic instruction.

From S. Burnum, Principal os the Emit Hill Classical Instituta, R. I.

'Phe perusal os your Second Latin Book has given me much satisfaction. In my
experience as 8 classical teacher‚ Ι have long felt the need osa work 01· this kind,
elucidating more fully than is usually done in Latin Grammar the nature and struc-
ture of Latin sentences, especially those that are complex and of more difficult con-
struction. 1 think that you have been very successful in making plain and easy
this most difficult and yet very important part of Latin Syntax. While, therefore
Ι am pleased with the readino extracts, Ι am especially so with the malaeum}
exercises. 1 shall at once introduce the work into mv school.
