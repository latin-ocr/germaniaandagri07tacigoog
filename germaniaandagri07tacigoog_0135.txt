011 the mountains which run through Suevia, 818 the Marsigni
Gothini, Osi and Burii, 43. Farther north are the Lygii, consist-
ing of many tribes, among which the most distinguished are the
Arii, Helvecones, Manimi, Elysii and Naharvali, 43. Still farther
north dwell the Gothones, and, at the Ocean, the Rugii and
Lemovii. Upon islands in the ocean live the Suiones, 44. Upon
the mainland, on the coast, are the tribes of the Aestyi, and near
them, ι perhaps on islands, the SitoneS, 45. Perhaps he assigned
to them the immense islands to which 118 refers in his first chapter.
Here ends Suevia.. whether the Peucini, Venedi and Fenni are to
be reckoned as Germans or Sarmatiam, isuncertain, 46. The Hel-
lusii and Oxonae are fabulous.”

The following paragraph from Prichard’s Researches embodies
some of the more general conclusione of ethnoyraphers, especially ot
Zeuss, on whom Prichard, in common with Orelli and many other
scholars, places great reliance. ‘⁴ AIong the coast of the German
Ocean and across the isthmus of the Cimbric peninsula to the shore
of the Baltic, were spread the tribes of the Chauci and Frisii, the
Anglii, Saxones and the Teutones 01· J utes, who spoke the Low·
German languages, and formed one of the four divisions of the
German race, corresponding as it seems with the Inyaevones 01
Tacitus and Pliny. In the higher and more central parts, the
second great division of the race, that of the Hermiones, was spread,
the tribes of which spoke Upper or Hiyh-Geman dialects. Begin-
ing in the West with the country of the Sigambri on the Rhino, and
from that of the Cherusci and Angrivarii near the Weser and the
Har-tz, this division comprehended, besides those tribes, the Chatti,
the Langobardi, the Hermunduri, the Marcomanni and Quadi, the
Lugii, and beyond the Vistula the Bastarnae, in the neighborhood
of the Carpathian 111118. To the eastward and northward of the last
mentioned, near the lower course of the Vistula and thence at least
as far as the Pregel, were the primitive abodes of the Goths and
their cognate tribes, who are perhaps the Istaevoneff The fourth
division of Prichard embraced the Scandinavians, who spoke a lan·
guage kindred to the Germans and were usually classed with them.
Those who would examine this subject more thoroughly, will con-
sult Adelung, Zeuss, Grimm, 311181, Ukert, Prichard, Imtham, dcc„
who have written expressly on the geography or the ethnography
of Germany.
