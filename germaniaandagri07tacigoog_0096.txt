politieal end, but as he himself informs us (§27)‚ to treat of the ori
gin and manners, the geography and history, of the German Tribes.

The same candor and sincerity, the same correctness and truthful-

ness, which characterize the Histories, mark also the work on Ger-
many. The author certainly aimed to speak the truth, and nothing

but the truth, on the subject of which he treats, Moreover, he had
abundant means of knowing the truth‚ on all the main points, in the
character and history of the Germane. It has even been argued
from such expression as vidimus (ἓ 8), that Tacitus had himself been
in Germany, and could, therefore, write from persona] observation.
But the argument proceeds on a misinterpretation of his language
(cf. note in loc. cit). And the use of accepimus (as in ἓ 27),
shows that he derived his information from others, But the Ro·
mans had been in constant intercourse and connection, civil or
military, with the Germans, for two hundred years. Germany sur-
nished a,wide theatre for their greatest commanders, and a fruitsul
theme for their best authors, some of whom, as Julius Caesar (to
whom Tacitus particularly refers, 28), were themselves the chief
actors in what they relate. These authors, some of whose contribu-
tions to the history of Germany are now lost (e. g. the elder Pliny,
who wrote twenty books on the German wars), must have all been
in the hands of Tacitus, and were, doubtless‚ consulted by him ; not,
however, as a servile copyist, or mere compiler (sor he sometimes
differs from his authorities, from Caesar even, whom he declares to
be the best of them), but as a discriminating and judicious inquirer. ⁸
The account of German customs and institutions may, therefore, be
relied on, from the intrinsic eredibility of the author. It receives.
confirmation, also, from its general accordance with other early ac-
counts of the Germans, and with their better known subsequeut
history, as well as from its strong analogy to the well-known habits
of our American aborigines, and other tribes in a like stage of civ-
ilization (cf. note, ξ 15). The geographica] details are composed
with all the accuracy which the ever-shifting positione and relations
of wari-ing and wandering tribes rendered possible in the nature of
the case (cf. note, ξ 28). In sentiment, the treatise is sui-passingly
rich and instructive, like all the works of this prinee os philosophical
historians. In style, it is concise and nervous, yet quite rhetorical,
and in parts, even poetical to a fault (see notes passim, cf. also,
Monboddo’s critique on the style of Tacitus). “The work,” says
La Bletterie, “is brief without being superficiaL within the com·
