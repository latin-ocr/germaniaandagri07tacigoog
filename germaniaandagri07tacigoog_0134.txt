only on historical data, but also on the traces of ancient names
still attached to citiea foresta, mountains, and other localities (cf⁴
note, ὓ 16). These we shall sometimes advert to in the notes.
But on the whole, these speculatione of German antiquarians are
not only less interesting to scholar-s in other countries‚ but are
so unsatisfactory and contradictory among themselves, that, for
the most part, we shall pass them over with very little atten-
tion. There is manifestly an intrinsic difficulty in defining the
ever changing limits of uncivilized and unsettled tribes. Hence
‘the irreconcilable contradictione between ancient authorities, a·
well as modern critiques‚ on this subject Tacitus, and the
Roman writers generally, betray their want of definite know·
ledge of Germany by the frequency with which they specify the
names of mountains and rivers. The following geographical out-
line is from Ukert, and must suffice for the yeoqraphy of the remain-
der of the 'steatisex “In the corner between the Rhine and the
Danube, are the Decumates Agri, perhaps as far as the Mayne, 29.
Northward on the Rhine dwell the Mattiaci, whose neighbors on
the east are the Chatti, 30. On the same river fal-ther north are the
Usipii and the Tencteri3 then the Frisii 32-34. Eastward of the
Tencteri dwell the Chamavi and the Angrivarii (earlier the Bruc-
teri), and east or southeast of them the Dulgibini and Chasuarii, 34,
and other small tribes. Eastward of the Frisii Germany juts out
far towards the north, 35. On the coast of the hay thus formed,
dwell the chauci, east of the Frisii and the above mentioned tribes3
on the south, they reach to the Chatti. East of the Chauci and
the Chatti are the Cherusci, 36, whose neighbors are the Fosi. The
Cherusci perhaps, according to Tacitus, do not reach to the ocean3
and in the angle of the above bay, he places the Cimbri, 37. Thus
Tacitus represents the western half of Germany. The eastern is of
greater dimensiona There are the Suevi, 38. {Ie calls the
country Suevia, 41. and enumerates many tribes, which belong
there. Eastward of the Cherusci he places the Semnones and
Langobardi· , north of them are the Reudigni, quiones, Anglii,
Varini, Eudoses, Suardones and N uithones; and all these he may
have regarded as lying in the interior, and as the most unknown
tribes, 41. He then mentions the tribes that dwell on the Danube,
eastward from the Decumates Agri: the Hermunduri, in whose
country.the Elbe has its source; the N arisci, Marcomanni and
Quadi. 41-42. The Marcomanni hold the country which the Boii
