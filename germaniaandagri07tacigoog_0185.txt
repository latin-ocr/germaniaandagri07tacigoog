without litterae, it occurs only here. Or. So in H. 3, ¹⁷⁹1. '1¹

used in this sense.

Dissimvdatione. Of. note, 6. - Aestimantibue, ef. aestimanti,
11. The aspiring‚ and ,especially the vain, may learn from this
passage a lesson of great praetieal value. Compare also § 8, at
the close.

XIX. Aliena experimenta. sse emper-ime of others.

Nihil. Ellipsis of ayere (which is inserted without MS. authority
in the common editions). So Cie. Phil. 1, 2: Nihil per senatum,

Ascire, al. aecire. To receive into reyadar service. The reference

he took eare to reeeive into the service none but the best men

mutually related to each other, the former with quisque, is frequent

Exequi—punire. A sense peculiar to the later Datin. Cic. and

Severitatem commodare. W. with Dr. and R. make this an

and not to severitatem. But commodare in its primary signifieation
means to adapt,· and 1n this sense, it suits both of its adjuncta. He
adapted (awarded) pardon to small offences, severe punishment to
yreat ones. So Wr. For the series of infinitiva, ef. notes, 5. noeen',
eta3 G. 30. praeponere, ete.

Nec poena—contentus esee. Nor was ke always content with pun·
ieknwnt, but oflener with repentanee. Mere punishment without
reformation did not satisfy him· ‚ reformation without punishment
satisfied him better. See Ded. in loe. Here too some have called
in the aid of zeugma. ·
