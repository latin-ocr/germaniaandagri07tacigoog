fine delineations of character, more substance and pith (sm), than
can be collected srom many a ponderous volume. It is not one oi
those barely agreeable descriptions, which gradually diffuse their
influence over the soul, and leave it in undisturbed tranquillity. It
is a picture in strong light, like the subject itself, fun of fire, of
sentiment, of lightning-flashes, that go at once to the beart. We
imagine ourselves in Germany; we become familiar with these so·
called barbarians3 we pardon their saults‚ and almost their vices,
out of regard to their virtues; and in our moments of enthusiasm,
we even wish we were Germans.’'

The following remarks os Murphy will illustrate the value of
the treatise, to modern Europeans and their descendants. “lt is a
draught os savage manners, delineated by a masterly hand; the
more interesting, as the part of the world which it describes was
the seminary of the modern Europcan nations, the vion-,x anrmn,
as historians have emphatically called it.. The work is short, but,
as Montesquieu observes, it is the work of a man who abridged
every thing, because he knew every thing. A thorough knowledge
of the transactions of barbarous ages, will throw more light than is
generally imagined on the laws of modern times. Wherever the

has prevailed in different parts of Europe. Tbey established mon-
archy and liberty, subordination and freedom, the prerogative of
the prince and the rights of the subject, all united in so bold a corn·
bination, that the fabric, in some places, stands to this hour the
wonder of mankind. The British constitution, says Montesquieu‚
came out of the woods of Gcrmany. What the state of this country
(Britain) was ’π afore the arrival of our Saxon ancestors, Tacitus has
shown in the life of Agricola. If we add to his account of the Ger-
mans and Britons, what has been transmitted to us, eonem-ning
them, by Julius Caesar, we shall see the origin of the Anglo-Saxon
government, tbe great outline of that Gothic constitution under
which the people enjoy their rights and liberties at this honr.
Montesquieu‚ speaking os his own country, declares it impossible to
form an adequate notion of the French monarchy, and the changes
of their government, without a previous inquiry into the manners,
geniuS, and spirit of the German nations. Mueh of what was in-
corporated with the institutions of those fierce invaders, has flowed
down in the stream of time, and still mingles with our modern
