will be in and aster the reign of a tyraut, preceded or followed
’ by what is still worse, anarchy. If the pure and the good
ever reverence purity and goodness, it will be amid the general
prevalence of vice and crime. If the sage ever pants after
wisdom, it is when the fountains of knowledge have become
corruptedff The reigns of Nero and his immediate successore
were probably the very school, of all others, to which we are
most t indebted for the comprehensive wisdom, the elevated
sentimentS, and the glowing eloquence of the biographer “ of
Agricola, and the historian of the Roman Empire. His youth
saw, and felt, and deplored the disastrous effecte of Nero's
inhuman despotism‚ and of the anarchy attending the civil
ware of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, His manhood saw, and
felt, and exulted iu the contrast furnished by the reigns of
Vespasian and Titus, though the sun of the latter too soon
went down, in that long night of gloom, and blood, and terror,
the tyranny of Domitian. And when, in the reigns of Nerva
and Trajan, he enjoyed the rare- felicity of thinking what he
pleased, and speaking what he thought, he was just fitted in
the maturity of his faculties, and the extent of his observation
and reflectione, “ to enroll slowly, year after year, that dreadful
reality of crimes and sufferings, which even dramatic horror,
in all its license of wild imagination, can scarcely reach, the
long unvarying catalogue of tyrants and executionem, and
victims that return thanks to the gods and die, and accusers
rich with their blood, and more mighty aa more widely hated,
amid the multitudes of prostrate Ἴ slaveS, still looking whether.
there may not yet have escaped some lingering virtue which
it may be a merit to desti-oy, and huing scarcely leisure ὶο
feel even the agonies of remorse in the continued sense of the
precariousness of their own gloomy existence.”*
