this way the name of a single tribe, and not of the whole people‚
has come into use, so that all, at first by the victor (the Tungri), in
order to inspire sear, then by themselves (by the mouth of the whole
people), when once the name became known, were called by the
name of Germans. That is, the Tungri called all the kindred
tribes that dwelt beyond the Rhine, Germana, in order to inspire
sear by the wide extension of the name, since they gave themselves
out to be a part of so vast a people; but at length all the tribes
began to 6611 themselves by this name, probably because they were
pleased to see the sear which it excited.'’ This is, on the whole, the
most satisfactory explanation of the passage, and meets the essential
concurrence of Wr.‚ Or. and Ded—Gemani. If of German etymo·

is subj. because it stands in a subordinate clause of the oratio obliqua,
cf. Gr. 266, 23 Z. 603.

Aletum. Here taken in an active sense3 oftener passive, but
used in both senses. Quintilian speaks of metum duplicem, quem
patimur et quem facimus (6, 2, 21). cf. Α. 44: nihil metus in vultu,
i. 6., nothing to inspire fear in his eountenance. In like manner
admiratio (ᾧ ’7) 16 used for the admiration which one excites, though
it usually denotes the admiration which one feels. For ob, cf. Ann.

Nationis—yentis. Gens is often used by Τ. 66 6 synonym with
natio. But in antithesis, qens is the whole, of which nationes or
populi are the parts. e. g. G. 4: populos-gentem3 ῤ 14: nationes-
genti. In like manner, in the civil constitution of Rome, a qens in-

Romans found their gods everywhere, and ascribed to Hercules,
